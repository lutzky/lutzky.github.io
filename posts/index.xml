Especially when you have multiple binaries depending on that vendor code, updating at different times, necessitating different live versions. Let&amp;rsquo;s explore.
Introduction Assume you&amp;rsquo;re working with an external vendor, who is providing you with code for a wonderful function getFoo:
// foo.h version 1.2.3 int getFoo(); // foo.c version 1.2.3 int getFoo() { sleep(1000); // TODO improve performance return 42 } You use this function in many of your products - for example, in your best-selling barApp application:</description></item><item><title>Reading, writing and vacations</title><link>https://lutzky.net/2013/03/27/reading-writing-and-vacation/</link><pubDate>Wed, 27 Mar 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://lutzky.net/2013/03/27/reading-writing-and-vacation/</guid><description>Vacations are a great time for doing that problematic category of things every management course teaches you about: important, but not urgent.

Writing, for me, is usually about practical stuff.

I&amp;rsquo;ve learned quite a bit from it, and had a chance to use a few of my favorite technologies.
The project was coded in Python, which is not my favorite programming language - Ruby is. However, since Python is more popular at my workplace, and seems to have a richer ecosystem around it (sometimes, at any rate), I&amp;rsquo;ve grown to love it almost as much over the years.</description></item><item><title>The show downloading stack - part n+1</title><link>https://lutzky.net/2011/12/15/the-show-downloading-stack-part-n1/</link><pubDate>Thu, 15 Dec 2011 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://lutzky.net/2011/12/15/the-show-downloading-stack-part-n1/</guid><description>I&amp;rsquo;ve already mentioned my show downloading stack on this blog.

Source control is super important. Mistakes will be made, other coders will want to join in, and experimental features will want to be in their own branches. Git is awesome; it does source control right, gives me powerful tools, and isn&amp;rsquo;t a hassle to set up - even for a small project like this.</description></item><item><title>Home network wiring</title><link>https://lutzky.net/2011/09/04/home-network-wiring/</link><pubDate>Sun, 04 Sep 2011 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://lutzky.net/2011/09/04/home-network-wiring/</guid><description>&lt;p>I don&amp;rsquo;t like wireless connections; they&amp;rsquo;re always second-best, be it in terms

It has quite a few new features:
Separate &amp;ldquo;Source&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;Destination&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Time&amp;rdquo; fields. This is much better for auto-completion as well. Automatic location-based detection of &amp;ldquo;Source&amp;rdquo;. Hopefully you&amp;rsquo;ll find the interface for this unobtrusive. Quick reversal of &amp;ldquo;Source&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Destination&amp;rdquo;, for your return trip. A new settings screen, with: Provider selection (currently Egged or MOT) A small attempt at right-to-left fixes for non-supporting devices.</description></item><item><title>SMS and why it annoys me</title><link>https://lutzky.net/2011/04/25/sms-and-why-it-annoys-me/</link><pubDate>Mon, 25 Apr 2011 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://lutzky.net/2011/04/25/sms-and-why-it-annoys-me/</guid><description>Don&amp;rsquo;t get me wrong. I love being able to communicate textually with friends, coworkers and family. It&amp;rsquo;s ideal for a noisy pub; a somewhat-private conversation on a crowded bus; telling something to someone who may be asleep, so they see it first thing when they wake up; making quick responses while in a meeting without being rude (well, at least at my workplace it&amp;rsquo;s considered perfectly acceptable). It&amp;rsquo;s also very handy when you want to tell someone something they ought to write down, such as a phone number or something they should remember to buy.</description></item><item><title>DD-WRT awesomeness</title><link>https://lutzky.net/2010/11/20/dd-wrt-awesomeness/</link><pubDate>Sat, 20 Nov 2010 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://lutzky.net/2010/11/20/dd-wrt-awesomeness/</guid><description>Since I&amp;rsquo;ve last posted, I&amp;rsquo;ve moved to a new apartment. First order of business - get a working internet connection. This is extra-challenging when your primary machine doesn&amp;rsquo;t even have a wireless network card.
My first hack used my trusty laptop - it has a properly working wireless card, and could connect to my roommate&amp;rsquo;s router quite easily. It runs Ubuntu, and as it turns out, that means sharing the connection was dead-simple: Right-click on the network manager icon, add a new wired connection called &amp;ldquo;Shared&amp;rdquo;, and under IPv4 settings, choose &amp;ldquo;Shared to other computers&amp;rdquo;.</description></item><item><title>Android</title><link>https://lutzky.net/2010/09/04/android/</link><pubDate>Sat, 04 Sep 2010 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://lutzky.net/2010/09/04/android/</guid><description>I&amp;rsquo;ve finally gotten the chance to get one of those newfangled Android phones.
I&amp;rsquo;ve recently &amp;ldquo;bought&amp;rdquo; a Samsung Galaxy Android phone (the older i7500, not the newer i9000 &amp;ldquo;S&amp;rdquo;) model. It&amp;rsquo;s a seriously serious upgrade from my old Nokia 6120 Classic, and as I broke the 6120&amp;rsquo;s screen and reverted back to my trusty old Nokia 6070 (which I couldn&amp;rsquo;t even get to run the GMail app), I was quite a happy camper switching to a modern phone.</description></item><item><title>Setting up Hebrew Android fonts on your AVD emulator</title><link>https://lutzky.net/2010/09/04/setting-up-hebrew-android-fonts-on-your-avd-emulator/</link><pubDate>Sat, 04 Sep 2010 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://lutzky.net/2010/09/04/setting-up-hebrew-android-fonts-on-your-avd-emulator/</guid><description>There are several good guides for installing Gilad Ben-Yossef&amp;rsquo;s excellent Hebdroid fonts on physical Android devices, but those don&amp;rsquo;t really work with the Android SDK&amp;rsquo;s emulator - changes to the system directory aren&amp;rsquo;t persistent. Here&amp;rsquo;s how to get around that:

I have a military phone, which is far cheaper, so I&amp;rsquo;ve decided to keep it offline. However, being the sentimental guy that I am, I did want to save all of my contacts and SMS messages (in addition to the photos, which presented less of a problem). This proved to be a bit of a challenge without the screen working.
Usually, when you connect the phone via USB, it asks if you want &amp;ldquo;PC Suite mode&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;Data Transfer mode&amp;rdquo;.</description></item><item><title>Loving the new Totem</title><link>https://lutzky.net/2009/10/10/loving-the-new-totem/</link><pubDate>Sat, 10 Oct 2009 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://lutzky.net/2009/10/10/loving-the-new-totem/</guid><description>Totem is Gnome&amp;rsquo;s built-in media player, and it really annoyed me in previous versions, and had me switching to VLC. However, the version included in the Ubuntu 9.10 release candidate has two features which are very important, in my opinion. The first feature is smooth graphical integration with compositing managers (such as compiz). In previous versions, as well as VLC, once you fullscreen the window, moving the mouse (which causes the cursor and the partial interface to appear) causes a very annoying flicker.</description></item><item><title>My show downloading stack</title><link>https://lutzky.net/2009/09/05/my-show-downloading-stack/</link><pubDate>Sat, 05 Sep 2009 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://lutzky.net/2009/09/05/my-show-downloading-stack/</guid><description>I love watching TV, and hate it.

First of all, you&amp;rsquo;ll need aspell-he, as pidgin uses gtkspell (which, in turn, uses aspell) rather than enchant (which supports hspell). There is a patch for gtkspell which gets it to use enchant, but I don&amp;rsquo;t know of a simple way to get it to work in my distribution of choice, Ubuntu.

One of them is myspace; today, in an attempt to make it more legible, I found that My Band&amp;rsquo;s Page implements all of its styling changes by a &amp;ldquo;style&amp;rdquo; tag hidden within the &amp;ldquo;Members&amp;rdquo; text block.</description></item><item><title>On the matter of a really long vacation</title><link>https://lutzky.net/2007/04/24/on-the-matter-of-a-really-long-vacation/</link><pubDate>Tue, 24 Apr 2007 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://lutzky.net/2007/04/24/on-the-matter-of-a-really-long-vacation/</guid><description>By now I&amp;rsquo;ve lost count of how long ago my last class was. The strike has begun immediately after passover, and is certainly beginning to take its toll. For one thing, I have no homework deadlines - a rare situation indeed for the Technion student. Furthermore, contemplations are rising about whether or not this coming summer semester will be held, as the current semester will most likely leak into it. This is of special interest to me, as I&amp;rsquo;m behind on my degree, which is problematic because of my military scholarship.</description></item><item><title>Grub menu.lst editor</title><link>https://lutzky.net/2007/04/19/grub-menu-lst-editor/</link><pubDate>Thu, 19 Apr 2007 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://lutzky.net/2007/04/19/grub-menu-lst-editor/</guid><description>A lot of people ask me how to change the default operating system booted after installing Linux.

Actual script lost in the mists of time&amp;hellip;
Download the file, open a terminal, and run gksudo python grubmenu.py

Python is my language of choice for it - let&amp;rsquo;s hope it works out well.
In the meantime, I&amp;rsquo;ve found a really nice python shell called iPython (available in apt) - it adds a bunch of stuff to the python shell which I sorely missed from irb - autocompletion, auto-indentation, and - it seems - adds a whole lot more.</description></item><item><title>Using Jabber from within the Technion</title><link>https://lutzky.net/2007/02/27/using-jabber-from-within-the-technion/</link><pubDate>Tue, 27 Feb 2007 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://lutzky.net/2007/02/27/using-jabber-from-within-the-technion/</guid><description>A very neat find for those of you who want to use Jabber from within the Technion, but with your client of choice rather than a web-based one: Many Jabber servers, including Google Talk, support using Port 443 over SSL. Since the Technion does not block outbound SSL connections, this will work there as well.

By the way - if any of you record with one of these, I highly recommend Arour, using a low-pass LADSPA filter.

DRM, in a practical sense, is deeply flawed: The idea is to give you your media - say, a WMA piece of music - and a program to play it with - say, Windows Media Player - but encrypt the media.</description></item><item><title>I know where waldo is</title><link>https://lutzky.net/2007/02/05/i-know-where-waldo-is/</link><pubDate>Mon, 05 Feb 2007 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://lutzky.net/2007/02/05/i-know-where-waldo-is/</guid><description>Well, penny knows.

The graphics card has relatively little RAM, so it finds handling my 1280x1024 resolution difficult when additional texture memory is needed - so using something like Firefox really slows it down when Beryl is activated, making me keep it off most of the time. However, for coding, I&amp;rsquo;m finding that Beryl is very useful - it actually helps me that the code windows are transparent, so that I can see what&amp;rsquo;s underneath them, and the &amp;ldquo;Expose&amp;rdquo; effect still leaves text legible, which is great for reading off a lot of terminals at once.</description></item><item><title>Software Perfection - Lost in the details</title><link>https://lutzky.net/2007/01/25/software-perfection-lost-in-the-details/</link><pubDate>Thu, 25 Jan 2007 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://lutzky.net/2007/01/25/software-perfection-lost-in-the-details/</guid><description>Sometimes imperfections in Software drive me nuts.
