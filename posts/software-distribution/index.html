interested in how software makes it onto a computer. &ldquo;Works on my machine&rdquo; was
never quite enough&mldr; how would it work on <em>someone else&rsquo;s</em> computer? Here&rsquo;s a
stroll down memory lane, starting from the 90s.</p><h2 id=qbasic-early-90s>QBasic (early 90s)</h2><p>In the early 90s, when I was about 8 years old, someone showed me that my
computer came with a piece of software called <a href=https://archive.org/details/msdos_qbasic_megapack target=_blank rel="noopener noreffer">QBasic</a> - it came with
the MS-DOS operating system. Although nobody in my family knew how to use it,
and this was long before I had access to the internet, it came with an
impressive set of examples as well as an interactive reference manual that I
recall as being very thorough. Having messed around with it and made a few
animations and utilities, I thought it would be cool to give copies to my
classmates to play around with; y&rsquo;know, like a professional software developer would.</p><figure><a class=lightgallery href=/posts/software-distribution/feature_QBasic_Opening_Screen.png title=/posts/software-distribution/feature_QBasic_Opening_Screen.png data-thumbnail=/posts/software-distribution/feature_QBasic_Opening_Screen.png data-sub-html="<h2>QBasic&rsquo;s opening screen</h2>"><img class=lazyload src=/svg/loading.min.svg data-src=/posts/software-distribution/feature_QBasic_Opening_Screen.png data-srcset="/posts/software-distribution/feature_QBasic_Opening_Screen.png, /posts/software-distribution/feature_QBasic_Opening_Screen.png 1.5x, /posts/software-distribution/feature_QBasic_Opening_Screen.png 2x" data-sizes=auto alt=/posts/software-distribution/feature_QBasic_Opening_Screen.png width=640 height=400></a><figcaption class=image-caption>QBasic&rsquo;s opening screen</figcaption></figure><p>The software, as I wrote it, was a collection of source code files - just text
files with a <code>.BAS</code> extension. For anyone to run those programs, they&rsquo;d have to
open QBasic themselves, select &ldquo;File→Open&rdquo;, navigate to my file, then use the
&ldquo;Run&rdquo; menu to actually run the program. And presumably figure out how to exit
QBasic when they&rsquo;re done. Now, 8-year-olds in the 90s were used to computers
being slightly harder to operate, e.g. typing out a command or two to open a
game; indeed, friends did figure this out. But this still felt like a <em>super
janky</em> way to distribute software.</p><p>What I actually wanted to do was provide a <em>&ldquo;self-contained&rdquo;</em> program, one where
you simply enter its name and it starts up, like any other DOS program I&rsquo;d seen.
Ideally, it would have the fashionable <code>.EXE</code> extension (the term &ldquo;<code>EXE</code> file&rdquo;
seemed pretty much synonymous with &ldquo;program&rdquo;).</p><div class="details admonition note"><div class="details-summary admonition-title"><i class="icon fas fa-pencil-alt fa-fw" aria-hidden=true></i>Note - Batch files<i class="details-icon fas fa-angle-right fa-fw" aria-hidden=true></i></div><div class=details-content><div class=admonition-content><p>What I wanted to do was allow people to run <code>LUTZKY1.BAS</code> with one command. This
could&rsquo;ve been accomplished by adding a file <code>LUTZKY1.BAT</code> (<code>BAT</code> for MS-DOS
Batch, not <code>BAS</code>) with these contents:</p><div class=highlight><div class=chroma><table class=lntable><tr><td class=lntd><pre tabindex=0 class=chroma><code><span class=lnt>1

</span></span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></div><p>I would&rsquo;ve needed to terminate the program using the <code>SYSTEM</code> command rather
than <code>END</code>. This way, indeed typing <code>LUTZKY1</code> into the prompt would&rsquo;ve run my
program and exit normally. However:</p><ul><li>I don&rsquo;t think I knew how to do that</li><li>It still flashes the QBasic IDE on startup</li><li>I was still relying on QBasic being installed on the destination machine, and
I knew (though?) older versions of MS-DOS didn&rsquo;t include it.</li><li>Having things in multiple files still seemed &ldquo;off&rdquo;. I now wonder if I
could&rsquo;ve designed a file to work both as the batch file and as the BASIC file.</li></ul></div></div></div><p>I had heard rumor of the &ldquo;professional, expensive&rdquo; bit of software I needed - a
<em>compiler</em>, which would perform the right magic to me a shiny, self-contained
<code>LUTZKY1.EXE</code>. But this sounded like an expensive thing to even ask my parents
for, never mind the fact I had no idea where one <em>buys software</em> - the local
shops only seemed to stock games and office productivity software.</p><div class="details admonition note open"><div class="details-summary admonition-title"><i class="icon fas fa-pencil-alt fa-fw" aria-hidden=true></i>Note<i class="details-icon fas fa-angle-right fa-fw" aria-hidden=true></i></div><div class=details-content><div class=admonition-content>In 2023, I found out that this software was called <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QuickBASIC target=_blank rel="noopener noreffer">QuickBASIC</a>&mldr;
not confusing at all, surely the Q in QBasic didn&rsquo;t stand for &ldquo;Quick&rdquo; and they
weren&rsquo;t both abbreviated &ldquo;QB&rdquo;.</div></div></div><p>For whatever reason, this was important enough to me to try some truly wacky
stuff. I vaguely remember messing around blindly with files on my computer,
trying to generate an <code>EXE</code> file complete with an icon - efforts included taking
something called the &ldquo;PIF Editor&rdquo;, which creates shortcuts to files and
ostensibly adds icons to them&mldr; and replacing one of the system <code>EXE</code> files
with it, in case the filename was &ldquo;magical&rdquo;. The real magic was young me
learning the valuable lesson that I should&rsquo;ve made a backup of this file before
replacing it.</p><h2 id=visual-basic-late-90s>Visual Basic (late 90s)</h2><p>By the late 90s, Windows 9x came around along with Microsoft Office, which had a
wonderful capability: <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_Basic_for_Applications target=_blank rel="noopener noreffer">Visual Basic for Applications</a>. this gave me my
first experience writing actual GUI applications, strangely embedded within an
Excel spreadsheet. Most memorably, Pokémon was a huge deal at the time, and I
had created &ldquo;APCO - A Pokémon Card Organizer&rdquo; - a trivial deck building app.</p><div class="details admonition note"><div class="details-summary admonition-title"><i class="icon fas fa-pencil-alt fa-fw" aria-hidden=true></i>Note - Pokémon<i class="details-icon fas fa-angle-right fa-fw" aria-hidden=true></i></div><div class=details-content><div class=admonition-content><p>On April 1st, 1997, the very first episode of the Pokémon anime was shown on
Israel, on channel 6; I was the official &ldquo;hero of the day&rdquo; guest, as a Pokémon
expert. I got to this position by nitpicking on some &ldquo;kids&rsquo; portal&rdquo; website that
their Pokémon page contained inaccuracies, which landed me a job as their
Pokémon card strategy reviewer; I was 11, so they paid me in Pokémon cards.</p><p>For the anime premiere I was interviewed by Dana Dvorin; I have sadly been
unable to find any footage of this hilariously awkward interview.</p></div></div></div><p>Once again, I wanted to distribute this software - perhaps using this magical
thing I now had access to called <em>The Internet</em>. And, once again, sending an
excel <code>XLS</code> file around with a big &ldquo;click me to start the actual program button&rdquo;
seemed, well, janky. Amazingly, a friend had a copy of &ldquo;really real Visual
Basic&rdquo; (the coveted <em>compiler</em> I had heard of), and was able to convert my janky
app-in-<code>XLS</code> to a proper shiny <code>EXE</code> file. Slight caveat - there was a runtime
library that had to be distributed alongside it, or it wouldn&rsquo;t work.</p><p>This got me looking at <em>installers</em>. All &ldquo;serious&rdquo; software was proudly using
InstallShield (this was before these newfangled <code>.MSI</code> files - even the
installer was a shiny <code>.EXE</code>!), but looking at a trial version left me
scratching my head at how things should be organized. Finally, a self-extracting
RAR file (yay shareware WinRAR) did the trick. I vaguely recall successfully
uploading the finished product to some download site of the era, probably
Tucows.</p><figure><a class=lightgallery href=/posts/software-distribution/installshield.png title=/posts/software-distribution/installshield.png data-thumbnail=/posts/software-distribution/installshield.png data-sub-html="<h2>If your software didn&rsquo;t come this way in the 90s, was it even real software?</h2>"><img class=lazyload src=/svg/loading.min.svg data-src=/posts/software-distribution/installshield.png data-srcset="/posts/software-distribution/installshield.png, /posts/software-distribution/installshield.png 1.5x, /posts/software-distribution/installshield.png 2x" data-sizes=auto alt=/posts/software-distribution/installshield.png width=504 height=379></a><figcaption class=image-caption>If your software didn&rsquo;t come this way in the 90s, was it even real software?</figcaption></figure><h2 id=linux-early-2000s>Linux (early 2000s)</h2><p>In high school, I was first introduced to Linux. It (Mandrake 8.1) came in 3 CDs
burned by a guy who couldn&rsquo;t have seemed shadier if he had pulled them out of a
trench-coat. Regardless, it was enlightening: How can this possibly be legally
free? Wait, it just <em>comes</em> with a compiler? What do you mean the compiler
doesn&rsquo;t contain a GUI? It was a fascinating dive into understanding what my
computer even <em>is</em>; while I was old enough to remember pre-Windows days, I had
switched to Linux from Windows 98<sup id=fnref:1><a href=#fn:1 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>1</a></sup>, so all of my experience with
Windows was as a graphical wrapper running inside DOS. For instance, not having
drive letters (A, B nor C) was <em>wild</em>.</p><div class="details admonition note"><div class="details-summary admonition-title"><i class="icon fas fa-pencil-alt fa-fw" aria-hidden=true></i>Note: Gentoo<i class="details-icon fas fa-angle-right fa-fw" aria-hidden=true></i></div><div class=details-content><div class=admonition-content><p>I didn&rsquo;t spend long with Mandrake before switching to Gentoo Linux, where
installing software is accomplished with the <code>emerge</code> command. The <code>emerge</code>
command magically (to me, at the time) gets the software from the internet and
<em>compiles</em> it. In my mind, I was Hackerman. In reality, it
was more often &ldquo;sorry dad, you can&rsquo;t use the computer today, a new version of
KDE just came out and the build will take a few hours&rdquo;. I stuck with Gentoo
until college<sup id=fnref:1><a href=#fn:1 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>1</a></sup>, when a stack of remarkably slick-looking envelopes with
Ubuntu CDs showed up. At this point Linux started seeming serious, and the &ldquo;year
of the linux desktop&rdquo; meme started to get to me. Ubuntu also killed off
install-fests<sup id=fnref:2><a href=#fn:2 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>2</a></sup>, as installing it was too easy to justify getting
friends and pizza together.</p><div class=footnotes role=doc-endnotes><hr><ol><li id=fn:1><p>My grandma got my old PC with it, so I can proudly say my grandma is

again. Lots of software came as shell scripts that ran <code>java</code>, meaning you had
to have the Java Runtime Environment installed. Python software came as scripts,
which needed not only Python itself installed, but usually some additional
python libraries. At this point I noticed the following:</p><ol><li>This only seems less janky in Linux because executables usually don&rsquo;t have
filename extensions; the difference between a &ldquo;clean <code>.EXE</code>&rdquo; and a &ldquo;janky
<code>.BAT</code>&rdquo; is tucked away in the file contents.</li><li>&ldquo;Proper&rdquo; C programs also need a bunch of stuff installed along with them.</li></ol><p>The Linux ecosystem has a dizzying array of solutions to this problem. From
meticulously<sup id=fnref:2><a href=#fn:2 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>2</a></sup> packaging DEB files through FlatPak/Snap/whatever
through Docker<sup id=fnref:3><a href=#fn:3 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>3</a></sup>. I&rsquo;m the kind of nerd who&rsquo;s excitedly following
<a href=https://fasterthanli.me/series/building-a-rust-service-with-nix target=_blank rel="noopener noreffer">FasterThanLime&rsquo;s series</a> about how Nix presumably does this
better than anything else.</p><h2 id=afterword---the-web>Afterword - the web</h2><p>At some point, probably too gradually for me to notice, web apps became actual
apps. XMLHttpRequest is horribly named, but pretty transformative when used by
sites to dynamically fetch more information; Javascript had gradually
transformed to &ldquo;the Assembly language of the web&rdquo; (i.e. it&rsquo;s the thing stuff
compiles to<sup id=fnref:4><a href=#fn:4 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>4</a></sup>); but the really cool thing about web apps remains
distribution: Just give people the URL.</p><p>Yes, there&rsquo;s work to do. You need a server, you need to handle its uptime and
connectivity (cloud has made this effectively trivial, even moreso for quick
demos with things like <a href=https://ngrok.com target=_blank rel="noopener noreffer">ngrok</a>). The app itself also needs to be written
differently: updates are nontrivial, if any state is saved then
backwards-compatibility becomes difficult, you need to handle different browsers
(and different device types); it&rsquo;s not easy. But a giant ecosystem has developed
around solving these problems, and the infrastructure to use the web has become,
by comparison, effectively ubiquitous. And to my 8-year-old self, there&rsquo;d be
nothing cooler than that: &ldquo;Forget the floppies, just give a note with your
address to your classmates; it&rsquo;s basically guaranteed to work on their
