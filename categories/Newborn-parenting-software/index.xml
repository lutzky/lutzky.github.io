<p>As noted in the <a href="https://lutzky.net/posts/software-parenting-2/" rel="">previous post</a>, I decided that the implementation is more appropriate for a microcontroller than a full-fledged computer. While the Arduino is probably the best-known microcontroller, the standard one doesn&rsquo;t have wifi (the one with wifi is ~$50). The ESP8266, on the other hand, is a microcontroller chip with wifi capabilities, available<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> on dev boards like the NodeMCU for about $2 apiece - so I bought a few of them. The ESP8266 is sometimes used as a wifi add-on for Arduino, but it&rsquo;s quite capable as a microcontroller on its own (and the newer ESP32 is faster).</p>
<p>So what&rsquo;s the difference between a (very small) computer and a microcontroller? A Raspberry Pi boots off an SD card, usually to a full-fledged Linux operating system; you&rsquo;d operate it either directly with a monitor and keyboard, or connect remotely using SSH. You can install/create software on it as you would on a &ldquo;full-size&rdquo; computer, and I usually do this in Go (although Python is more popular). Conversely, a microcontroller will usually run only one program, which you need to build on a separate computer, connect it over USB to the microcontroller board, and flash it. This has a number of advantages, including simplicity and pretty-much-instant boot.</p>
<p>Coding for the ESP8266 can be done using the same tooling as Arduino - namely, in C++<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>, on the Arduino IDE. However, during this project I learned of <a href="https://platformio.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">PlatformIO</a>, which is far more comfortable to work with: It&rsquo;s integrated into VSCode, and git, auto-formatting, autocomplete and <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vscodevim.vim" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">VIM keybindings</a> all work nicely. It also provides a more organized approach to unit testing (practically absent in Arduino IDE) and per-project dependency management (you can list what each project needs and have it auto-install). This made the project fun enough for a few iterations.</p>
<p>One quirk of working with the BabyBuddy API is that reporting a diaper change requires supplying the time of change, even if our intention is &ldquo;right now&rdquo;. That&rsquo;s easy enough on a Linux system, but microcontrollers don&rsquo;t generally have clocks. Thankfully, libraries such as <a href="https://github.com/mcxiaoke/ESPDateTime" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">ESPDateTime</a> provide NTP support baked right into your program. At this point, the NodeMCU version worked, and replaced the previous implementation:</p>
<figure><a class="lightgallery" href="/posts/software-parenting-3/feature-poobuttons-v2.jpg" title="/posts/software-parenting-3/feature-poobuttons-v2.jpg" data-thumbnail="/posts/software-parenting-3/feature-poobuttons-v2.jpg" data-sub-html="<h2>Poobuttons v2 - nodeMCU on breadboard</h2>">
        
    </a><figcaption class="image-caption">Poobuttons v2 - nodeMCU on breadboard</figcaption>
    </figure>
<p>Indeed, this version fits neatly onto a single (full-sized) breadboard. It&rsquo;s not quite <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PE-_rJqvDhQ" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">Ben Eater</a> grade, but the NodeMCU is pretty good for breadboard mounting, and using solid-core jumpers let me make it much neater than the previous iteration. However, at this point we realized there was a missing feature: We were never quite sure if we had pressed the button, especially if we were performing a diaper change together<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup> . A couple of LEDs can only convey so much information.</p>
<p>I decided to repurpose my <a href="https://lutzky.net/2021/03/14/pitemp/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">shitty cardboard LCD case</a> for this project. These tactile buttons have quite short feet - they don&rsquo;t make it through the cardboard, and I insisted on avoiding using a perfboard and soldering iron - as, at the time, I had neither. I ultimately decided to reuse the mini-breadboard from <a href="https://lutzky.net/posts/software-parenting-2/" rel="">the previous version</a>; like many (all?) breadboards, its bottom is an adhesive pad; I didn&rsquo;t even bother to remove the resistors from V1, they add a certain design flare to it. With a few iterations on the UI, it was wife-approved: Custom characters are fully supported in C++ (though, not in Go), so I got nice labels for the tactile buttons, as well as a heartbeat<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup> to indicate that NTP is still working.</p>

<p>Overall, the project has been a blast, and the result is everyday-useful. Working on it has made me realize how much I need my own space for late-night electronics projects, but that&rsquo;s a project for another day.</p>

<p>With BabyBuddy now installed and running properly (see <a href="https://lutzky.net/posts/software-parenting-1/" rel="">previous post</a>), and an always-on display showing the latest information, we now got into the swing of using it. We loved the timeline for &ldquo;what happened while I as sleeping&rdquo;; we loved the food amount reports; and because we had a consistent &ldquo;feed, then change, then wait 15 minutes with baby upright to reduce spit-up&rdquo; system, the display&rsquo;s &ldquo;time since last change&rdquo; box was super useful as well. However, as you might imagine, we did <em>not</em> love handling a freshly-re-diapered baby with one hand while using the other to unlock the phone and navigate to the &ldquo;yes he pooped now&rdquo; page in a web app.</p>
<p>My first idea was to create voice commands for the Nest Home Mini in the room. However, it&rsquo;s prone to misunderstanding us; you have to enunciate, and even then the speech recognition is mostly tuned to preexisting Google Assistant commands, and tends to guess that we aren&rsquo;t really saying words like &ldquo;pee&rdquo; or &ldquo;poo&rdquo;. Furthermore, the baby might be crying, or worse yet - lightly sleeping, at risk of being woken up by our voice (or the assistant&rsquo;s). What we needed was a button (well, two - one for pee and one for poo).</p>
<p>I had a Raspberry Pi ZeroW lying around <a href="https://lutzky.net/posts/pitemp/" rel="">from a previous project</a> and decided to use it for this (the small OLED display wasn&rsquo;t used for this project, but I didn&rsquo;t find a good reason to take it off yet; more on that later). With bits I had from a generic &ldquo;learn electronics&rdquo; kit (which I bought for the specific purpose of having such bits), I created the user interface: Two buttons, a green LED for &ldquo;OK&rdquo;, a red LED for &ldquo;something went wrong&rdquo;; all tied together by some jumper cables and a mini breadboard. The Raspberry Pi would handle communicating with BabyBuddy&rsquo;s API (over wifi), reading the buttons, and driving the LEDs. The setup was indeed quite similar to PiTemp&rsquo;s with the software written in Go, cross-compiled, and run on startup using systemd.</p>
<figure><a class="lightgallery" href="/posts/software-parenting-2/feature-poobuttons-rpi0w.jpg" title="/posts/software-parenting-2/feature-poobuttons-rpi0w.jpg" data-thumbnail="/posts/software-parenting-2/feature-poobuttons-rpi0w.jpg" data-sub-html="<h2>PooButtons on Raspberry Pi ZeroW</h2>">
        
    </a><figcaption class="image-caption">PooButtons on Raspberry Pi ZeroW</figcaption>
    </figure>
<p>One annoying quirk with the Raspberry Pi Zero for this is that it would register phantom button presses; they&rsquo;d be quite rare, fewer than 5 a day, but that&rsquo;s certainly enough to mess up diaper reporting. I&rsquo;m not sure if it&rsquo;s something about the particular GPIO pins I used (GPIO24, GPIO22), and disconnecting the OLED display didn&rsquo;t work. I ended up following the old joke:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>How many software engineers does it take to change a lightbulb?</p>
<p>None, it&rsquo;s a hardware problem.</p>
<p>How many hardware engineers does it take to change a lightbulb?</p>
<p>None, they&rsquo;ll fix it in the software drivers.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Specifically it ended up looking something like this (with another goroutine listening on the resulting channel):</p>

</div><p>It&rsquo;s not ideal, but it seemed to work; certainly seemed like it should be library code, for someone smarter to debug. Indeed, it turns out that the <code>periph.io</code> library had a <a href="https://pkg.go.dev/periph.io/x/conn/v3@v3.6.8/gpio/gpioutil#Debounce" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">Debounce function</a> to help with this, but at the time it <a href="https://github.com/periph/conn/issues/5" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">wasn&rsquo;t implemented at all</a> (and now that I&rsquo;ve spent some time on it, it&rsquo;s partially implemented).</p>
<p>Ultimately, the device worked rather well, and the button pushes were quite satisfying, especially after a particularly nasty diaper change (AKA a poonami). However, it did leave a lot to be desired: The cabling was flimsy and patchy (the pins coming from the ribbon were easy to disconnect), and using a Raspberry Pi here was overkill. Indeed, I ended up using that Raspberry Pi (and OLED display) as a <a href="https://pikvm.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">PiKVM</a>, and using a microcontroller for the diaper change buttons instead. More on that in the next post.</p>

<p>A few months ago, I became a father. To help overcome some of the challenges of raising a newborn, I decided to employ my standard MO - software; preferably the kind where I understand what it&rsquo;s doing. It&rsquo;s been working well, and I learned a lot doing it - several blog posts&rsquo; worth, in fact.</p>
<p>For this story to make sense, it bears mentioning that our conditions are pretty much optimal for it: My employer provides a generous parental leave for the non-birth parent; we decided in advance to formula-feed, which allows us to share that load, which means we need to communicate about it; my partner is an early bird whereas I am a night-owl, meaning we essentially have separate shifts necessitating a handoff; and, critically, we&rsquo;re the type of people who <em>like</em> everything being super-organized and scheduled and spreadsheet-y (calms us down, gives us an illusion of control). Furthermore, our baby is remarkably consistent, being hungry right about every 3 hours - so the question we ended up constantly asking (of each other and our phones) was &ldquo;how long since the baby ate&rdquo;.</p>
<p>We knew in advance we&rsquo;d need some sort of a baby tracking app, of which there are <em>many</em>. After some research, I found that few of the free ones are designed to be used from multiple devices (e.g. dad&rsquo;s and mom&rsquo;s phones), which is a hard requirement. We found two contenders: Baby+ and BabyBuddy.</p>
<h2 id="baby">Baby+</h2>
<p><a href="https://philips-digital.com/baby-new/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">Baby+</a> is an Android and iPhone app for tracking babies; it follows <a href="https://philips-digital.com/pregnancy-new/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">pregnancy+</a>, which we were quite happy with (especially as, before the birth, our responsiveness requirements were looser - I&rsquo;ll get to that). It can track quite a few things, but not Tummy Time for one (in our case it turns out to be pretty important). Like pregnancy+, the design is very aesthetically pleasing, and it regularly shows timely, short, and useful articles for the parents.</p>
<p>While the app does have cloud sync, it doesn&rsquo;t have a web UI (it&rsquo;s phone/tablet-only) nor an open HTTP API for me to reasonably code against. It does have an export function, but it&rsquo;s only really intended for importing by the app itself as backup. It&rsquo;s super-clunky to work with - I know because I ended up using it to perform some analysis with a spreadsheet(&ldquo;how long is the baby going between feeds&rdquo;).</p>
<p>The biggest disadvantage of Baby+ is that it doesn&rsquo;t <em>really</em> support multiple users. From the app&rsquo;s internal FAQ (only available after installing it and setting up an account):</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>How can I use this app with my partner?</strong></p>
<p>You can share the app by logging in with the <strong>same email and password</strong>. If you use your device and enter data (e.g. a note) then you need to minimise or close the app for it to send the new data to the server <em>[&hellip;]</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Important</strong>: the app is designed to be used by on person at a a time <em>[&hellip;]</em> otherwise data can be overwritten or deleted. <em>[&hellip;]</em> allow a few mins for the data to sync (the second device should also have the app closed for a few mins at this point so it can fetch the data <em>[&hellip;]</em>).</p>
<p>Please note that you will encounter data loss if you are using the app on two devices at the same time.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;d guess that the app basically talks to the server on startup, compares timestamps of its entire database, and downloads or uploads the entire database depending on which version is newer. The startup time checks out:</p>
<p>Starting Baby+ on an android phone, after closing it so it syncs, takes about 7 seconds; an eternity in screaming-baby-debug-time. Furthermore, that doesn&rsquo;t include sync time, and old data will be shown for a few more seconds before the sync is complete; that starts off with slight frights (&ldquo;the baby didn&rsquo;t eat for 5 hours?! oh, wait, actually 1 hour&rdquo;), and eventually devolves into distrusting the app.</p>
<p>This felt like a silly problem to have; almost any web-based app would have none of these issues. Furthermore, I thought, there&rsquo;s surely an open-source one where I could fix any annoyances I have myself. Indeed, that would be BabyBuddy.</p>
<h2 id="babybuddy">BabyBuddy</h2>
<p><a href="https://github.com/babybuddy/babybuddy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">BabyBuddy</a> is an open-source web app, self-described as &ldquo;to help caregivers track sleep, feedings, diaper changes, and tummy time to learn about and predict baby&rsquo;s needs without (as much) guess work&rdquo;. I describe it as &ldquo;the dumbest-sounding idea ever - sleep-deprived parents of newborns creating and maintaining baby-tracking software as a hobby&rdquo;. It turns out to be wonderful, and is what we use today. It requires self-hosting (but provides a button to do that easily on Heroku), but works remarkably well. It didn&rsquo;t work <em>exactly</em> like I wanted, but that just provided ample opportunity to hack on it.</p>
<p>Before we could use it, I had to make it more mobile-friendly. While it technically worked on phones, it had several usability issues, which I described in <a href="https://github.com/babybuddy/babybuddy/issues/229" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">#229</a>: horizontal scrolling was needed in places; the &ldquo;Timeline&rdquo; view didn&rsquo;t show a lot of the critical bits of info, requiring more clicks; the contrast was too low for sunlight; and more. Fortunately, through some wonderful collaboration from the author, I was able to quickly get it into a wife-acceptable state and transition us over from Baby+.</p>
<p>As I hacked on the project, I added a <a href="https://gitpod.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">Gitpod</a> <a href="https://github.com/babybuddy/babybuddy/blob/master/.gitpod.yml" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">config</a> and a link to the README. This allows people to hack on Babybuddy without installing any software whatsoever - everything is done through, essentially, a free tier cloud instance (on which my config will install everything needed) with a browser-builtin VSCode UI. I used this today to whip up <a href="https://github.com/babybuddy/babybuddy/pull/316" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">another pull request</a>.</p>
<p>In addition to being quick and comfortable to use, BabyBuddy allowed me to set up two integrations that I had in mind. The first is an always-on display, essentially intended as &ldquo;the baby clock&rdquo;. It&rsquo;s positioned by the couch where we usually feed, so it&rsquo;s great as a feeding timer as well. I had started out with an old tablet (Huawei T3 Mediapad) running <a href="https://github.com/thanksmister/wallpanel-android" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">wallpanel</a> - this is a form of &ldquo;kiosk&rdquo; application, which locks the device into a mode where it always runs the browser on a particular page (the device has no other credentials on it, so it&rsquo;s reasonably safe). The tablet&rsquo;s battery, unfortunately, did <em>not</em> like that - seemingly having the screen on discharges it faster than it can charge, and after a few weeks the tablet refused to charge at all. I&rsquo;ve therefore switched to using an old ASUS C100P Chromebook running <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/kiosk/afhcomalholahplbjhnmahkoekoijban?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">kiosk</a> - this gives the benefit of having a physical keyboard, useful for entering the food amounts.</p>
<p>The second integration I call &ldquo;poobuttons&rdquo; - a couple of tactile buttons on the changing dresser which tell BabyBuddy to mark a diaper (they are labeled &ldquo;poo&rdquo; and &ldquo;pee&rdquo;). This is both easier than fumbling with a phone touchscreen and, frankly, way more satisfying. The next posts will detail the iterations of these buttons and how I built them.</p>
<p>This has been a wonderful and challenging journey so far. I wonder what else I&rsquo;ll find myself building.</p>
