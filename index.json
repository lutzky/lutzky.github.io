With kid #2, we’re older, wiser, more tired, and have a slightly different strategy. We still love tracking stuff, and BabyBuddy (a self-hosted baby tracking application) is still the best option. However, a couple of things have changed: First, the poo buttons have largely been replaced with a wall-mounted tablet displaying our HomeAssistant UI (which, indeed, has buttons for nappy recording). Secondly, and more significantly - kid #2 is breastfed. One of the advantages of breastfeeding is that some moms can, in the middle of the night, feed a hungry baby while barely waking up themselves. Unfortunately, if mom is interested in tracking the breastfeeding, and needs to unlock the phone (multiple times) and perform additional taps, this doesn’t work, and she wakes up. Most interactive software is, perhaps unsurprisingly, designed for people who are wide awake. So - home automation to the rescue! I already have a bunch of IKEA shortcut buttons which work nicely with HomeAssistant through a my ConnBee 2, and IKEA’s newer SOMRIG shortcut buttons provide 2-buttons-in-1. All I need is 3 options (provided by 2 such SOMRIG units) - “start timer”, “stop timer and mark that as a left-breast feeding”, and “stop timer and mark that as right-breast”. These button devices are wonderfully compact and their batteries last pretty long. This has to do with the fact that they have no screen, so unfortunately no way of indicating whether they worked or not; and they don’t always work on the first click. Fortunately, I had an old IKEA desk-lamp with a Zigbee RGB lightbulb I hadn’t really found use for. This lamp has now become a floor-based night-light to indicate the status: Dim blue when the timer is on (during feeding) When feeding is done, green or orange for a few seconds (depending on the side) …and back off. Indeed, a few smart buttons and a literal lightbulb-moment of an idea are allowing my wife to go back to sleep much more quickly, without giving up on our shared tracking obsession. It’s amazing how much of a quality-of-life difference you can make with some straightforward home automation.

Let’s have a quick primer on how those work, and look at a small utility to help reason about it. zsnapfree is a TUI for showing how much space can be reclaimed by freeing zfs snapshots. It is a TUI wrapper over the standard zfs tool. If you just want to see zsnapfree in action, skip to the screencast.

Although the “Recycle bin” protects you against accidentally deleting files, most filesystems don’t protect against accidentally modifying them. To change files back, you want a filesystems with snapshots. A snapshot is extremely fast to make, and lets you access the contents of the file as it was when the snapshot was taken. In ZFS, with zfs-auto-snapshot installed, the experience might look like this: A ZFS filesystem called /tank/videos exists. A file /tank/videos/renders/my_video.mp4 exists, but I accidentally overwrite it. The file has existed for a while, so zfs-auto-snapshot has already created a snapshot of the good version at 14:17; specifically, it’s called zfs-auto-snap_hourly-2024-08-20-1417. The good version is therefore available at (takes a breath) /tank/videos/.zfs/snapshot/zfs-auto-snap_hourly-2024-08-20-1417/renders/my_video.mp4. We’ll get back to those long snapshot names later. For now, it’s worth sketching out how this works. The actual ZFS implementation is more complex, but roughly speaking, you can imagine that the videos “current-state” is represented by a table that includes rows describing what 128KB blocks make up each file. If our file renders/my_video.mp4 is 128MB, it will be made up of 1024 blocks, and the table might have a section like this: File renders/my_video is represented by virtual blocks 1000 through 2023. Virtual block 1000 is in physical location 5001 Virtual block 1001 is in physical location 6713 … To create a snapshot, we only need to duplicate the information above, which is roughly 8KB, so this can be done quickly and for very little extra space. However, what happens when the data changes? Snapshots should remain immutable even if the “current-state” changes. Suppose for instance we change the very first block in the file - virtual block 1000. What happens now is the titular “copy-on-write” - the block which needs to be rewritten will first be copied. Physical location 5001 would be duplicated to a new location, say 7001, and this version of the block will be modified. The current-state table would be updated to say that virtual block 1000 is in physical location 7001 (but the snapshot would still have it listed as physical location 5001). Importantly, physical location 5001 is still in use, and cannot be freed. There would likely be a table keeping reference counts for each physical location; after the last snapshot referencing it would be deleted, this space can be reclaimed.

You find yourself running out of space, and decide to delete that file… but no space is recovered. The reason is that snapshots still hold this data, and you would need to delete all of those snapshots in order to reclaim it. The question is… which ones? Although you can run zfs list -t snapshot -o space, the USED column there only counts space used by files which are unique to that snapshot. That is, if another snapshot has been created (e.g. by zfs-auto-snapshot), the USED column will count that file as zero. Fortunately, ZFS has a great utility for previewing this. If we believe that the file was created just before snapshot1, and deleted just after snapshot3, then we can do this: $ zfs destroy -nv tank/video@snapshot1,snapshot2,snapshot3 would destroy tank/video@snapshot1 would destroy tank/video@snapshot2 would destroy tank/video@snapshot3 would reclaim 100GB This command actually does nothing (-n) except show information. Critically, running it with just one or two of the snapshots would reclaim 0GB, so this is great for harmless reasoning about what snapshots we’d need to sacrifice to reclaim space. There’s even a handy % “range” operator, so we could rewrite the above as tank/videos@snapshot1%snapshot3.

This makes trying different snapshot selections cumbersome, and prompted me to write my very first TUI app in Rust. It’s a simple wrapper around the zfs command, and, well, a video is worth several words: When selecting snapshots, the tool runs (after a short delay) zfs destroy -n to show how much space would be reclaimed. On exit, it shows the appropriate commandline to check its findings and, if removing -n, actually perform the deletion. Hopefully this is of some use for ZFS users, and I would love any patches to add support for other filesystems that have snapshot support!

By default in Ubuntu, the shutdown process is hidden, but pressing ESC showed that anacron was waiting on something indefinitely… and indeed, given a few dozen minutes, it would complete. Sure, Raising Small Elephants Is Utterly Boring1 can fix that, but something seemed wrong.

I like to run this on my desktop as well, so I can retroactively diagnose issues or obsess over the specific fan speeds that led to a mildly annoying hum in the quiet evening. Netdata installs a self-update cron job, which is sensible. It’s installed in /etc/cron.daily, which by default is launched every day at 6:25 AM. This would cause all machines it’s installed on, within a timezone, to hit the servers simultaneously; to avoid this, they added jitter - the update script randomly waits between 0 and NETDATA_UPDATER_JITTER, the default being 60 minutes. So, if you’re trying to reboot just after 06:25 AM, you’re probably going to wait an extra 30-ish minutes.

However, machines that are often off or suspended would likely miss the specific timing of the scheduled tasks. For such machines, anacron is used instead, and tries to make sure that daily tasks still occur daily: Once an hour, anacron will wake up (if the machine is on) and check whether any daily tasks still need to be run that day. That means that if I first turn on my computer in the evening, it has updates and wants to reboot, and I let it - I have a really high chance of netdata-updater being called, and of this little maneuver costing me 30-ish minute of precious gaming time. Anacron naturally introduces jitter, and anacron has additional jitter-introducing mechanisms2. Indeed, there’s no need to add jitter to netdata-updater running under anacron, so I changed NETDATA_UPDATER_JITTER to 0, and indeed my suggestion to make this the default under anacron was accepted. That being said, it still seemed there’s no good reason for shutdown to wait over 10 minutes for anacron to shutdown. The shutdown screen showed that the timeout was infinite, although the systemd default3 is 90 seconds. That’s because anacron.service has this line: TimeoutStopSec=infinity This was added in this commit, to resolve this bug. A more elegant solution is possible, but discouraged because anacron is meant to be replaced by something called “cronie”; I am familiar with this pain. One way or another, I disagree with the reasoning, at least in my own particular case, and have decided to comment out the infinite timeout line.

I’ve been doing this for my dotfiles for quite a while, but not for my overall machine config. Tweaks like this, to my system config, are something I’d rather have a script to do rather than writing it down in a checklist. As it turns out, Ansible is considered to be a good tool for this. I thought it’s only useful for “apply some settings to a large set of servers”, but apparently “maintain config for my one server” is not such a strange use-case.

I keep forgetting to turn off my alarm as I leave home, and then scrambling to turn it off1. Even if I do remember to turn it off, I’m never quite sure that I did, so I take my phone out, open the appropriate app, and check. It would be super convenient if I had a little indicator near the door, so I (or anyone else leaving) could check more quickly. A single red LED would technically do the job… but wouldn’t be wife-approved. I love tiny OLED displays. Let’s use one of those! I got an ESP8266 with an onboard OLED display, and thanks to ESPhome, having a display of the alarm status is easy enough. There’s still plenty of room on the display, so I figured I can add a couple of other things I quickly check before leaving home: Weather and tram times. I used the Edit Undo font and some Material Icons for a bit of styling. I ended up having to mess with exact spacing a lot until I was happy with it; it would be super helpful if there were a simulator like wokwi for ESPHome to iterate on this more quickly! The resulting device without a case Next step is to create a case for it. This is necessary both for wife-approval and for cleaner mounting to the wall. I use Onshape for this, as it’s both free and parametric - that is, I can change numbers later to adjust the design without fully re-doing it; and if there’s one thing I’ve learned about designing for 3D printing, is that it takes a few iterations to get it right: Print, learn that it almost works, adjust, repeat. Iterating on the case design in Onshape With this design, I got some nice shadow lines. I had originally planned to use screws, but it turned out to be fairly annoying: While the PCB does have holes for mounting screws, there isn’t a lot of room for nuts; it ended up being simpler to make a fully plastic snap-fit design. Snap-fit, especially with 3D printing, is an even worse source of trial-and-error iterations, as there seems to be a fine line between “doesn’t snap” and “snaps off altogether”, especially with smaller designs. It doesn’t help that I’m using a somewhat older Ultimaker 5 printer with PLA material; I know there are more modern and robust printers, but the Ultimaker 5 is maintained by experts at our maker room, which only allows PLA, and I figured it should be doable. Thankfully, I was right! I’m really happy with the final result, and it’s proving to be at-a-glance useful every day.

Although nobody in my family knew how to use it, and this was long before I had access to the internet, it came with an impressive set of examples as well as an interactive reference manual that I recall as being very thorough. Having messed around with it and made a few animations and utilities, I thought it would be cool to give copies to my classmates to play around with; y’know, like a professional software developer would. QBasic’s opening screen The software, as I wrote it, was a collection of source code files - just text files with a .BAS extension. For anyone to run those programs, they’d have to open QBasic themselves, select “File→Open”, navigate to my file, then use the “Run” menu to actually run the program. And presumably figure out how to exit QBasic when they’re done. Now, 8-year-olds in the 90s were used to computers being slightly harder to operate, e.g. typing out a command or two to open a game; indeed, friends did figure this out. But this still felt like a super janky way to distribute software. What I actually wanted to do was provide a “self-contained” program, one where you simply enter its name and it starts up, like any other DOS program I’d seen. Ideally, it would have the fashionable .EXE extension (the term “EXE file” seemed pretty much synonymous with “program”). Note - Batch files What I wanted to do was allow people to run LUTZKY1.BAS with one command. This could’ve been accomplished by adding a file LUTZKY1.BAT (BAT for MS-DOS Batch, not BAS) with these contents: @REM Turn off janky \"print each command\" behavior @REM Mind the load-bearing @ at the start of each line... @ECHO OFF QBASIC /RUN LUTZKY1.BAS I would’ve needed to terminate the program using the SYSTEM command rather than END. This way, indeed typing LUTZKY1 into the prompt would’ve run my program and exit normally. However: I don’t think I knew how to do that It still flashes the QBasic IDE on startup I was still relying on QBasic being installed on the destination machine, and I knew (though?) older versions of MS-DOS didn’t include it. Having things in multiple files still seemed “off”. I now wonder if I could’ve designed a file to work both as the batch file and as the BASIC file. I had heard rumor of the “professional, expensive” bit of software I needed - a compiler, which would perform the right magic to me a shiny, self-contained LUTZKY1.EXE. But this sounded like an expensive thing to even ask my parents for, never mind the fact I had no idea where one buys software - the local shops only seemed to stock games and office productivity software. Note In 2023, I found out that this software was called QuickBASIC… not confusing at all, surely the Q in QBasic didn’t stand for “Quick” and they weren’t both abbreviated “QB”. For whatever reason, this was important enough to me to try some truly wacky stuff. I vaguely remember messing around blindly with files on my computer, trying to generate an EXE file complete with an icon - efforts included taking something called the “PIF Editor”, which creates shortcuts to files and ostensibly adds icons to them… and replacing one of the system EXE files with it, in case the filename was “magical”.

And, once again, sending an excel XLS file around with a big “click me to start the actual program button” seemed, well, janky. Amazingly, a friend had a copy of “really real Visual Basic” (the coveted compiler I had heard of), and was able to convert my janky app-in-XLS to a proper shiny EXE file. Slight caveat - there was a runtime library that had to be distributed alongside it, or it wouldn’t work. This got me looking at installers. All “serious” software was proudly using InstallShield (this was before these newfangled .MSI files - even the installer was a shiny .EXE!), but looking at a trial version left me scratching my head at how things should be organized. Finally, a self-extracting RAR file (yay shareware WinRAR) did the trick. I vaguely recall successfully uploading the finished product to some download site of the era, probably Tucows. If your software didn’t come this way in the 90s, was it even real software?

It (Mandrake 8.1) came in 3 CDs burned by a guy who couldn’t have seemed shadier if he had pulled them out of a trench-coat. Regardless, it was enlightening: How can this possibly be legally free? Wait, it just comes with a compiler? What do you mean the compiler doesn’t contain a GUI? It was a fascinating dive into understanding what my computer even is; while I was old enough to remember pre-Windows days, I had switched to Linux from Windows 981, so all of my experience with Windows was as a graphical wrapper running inside DOS. For instance, not having drive letters (A, B nor C) was wild. Note: Gentoo I didn’t spend long with Mandrake before switching to Gentoo Linux, where installing software is accomplished with the emerge command. The emerge command magically (to me, at the time) gets the software from the internet and compiles it. In my mind, I was Hackerman. In reality, it was more often “sorry dad, you can’t use the computer today, a new version of KDE just came out and the build will take a few hours”. I stuck with Gentoo until college1, when a stack of remarkably slick-looking envelopes with Ubuntu CDs showed up. At this point Linux started seeming serious, and the “year of the linux desktop” meme started to get to me. Ubuntu also killed off install-fests2, as installing it was too easy to justify getting friends and pizza together. My grandma got my old PC with it, so I can proudly say my grandma is a former Gentoo user. She exclusively used the browser, but whenever she needed support I was the only one who could provide it, as any other support people invariably tried to get her to find the “start” menu, even when the problem was entirely within gmail. ↩︎ If anyone has footage of the install-fest I was forced to trick Moshik Afia to go to, as part of פעם בחיים on Yes, please send it my way! ↩︎ As I dove deeper into Linux, I realized I’m seeing some of the older jank once again. Lots of software came as shell scripts that ran java, meaning you had to have the Java Runtime Environment installed. Python software came as scripts, which needed not only Python itself installed, but usually some additional python libraries. At this point I noticed the following: This only seems less janky in Linux because executables usually don’t have filename extensions; the difference between a “clean .EXE” and a “janky .BAT” is tucked away in the file contents. “Proper” C programs also need a bunch of stuff installed along with them. The Linux ecosystem has a dizzying array of solutions to this problem. From meticulously2 packaging DEB files through FlatPak/Snap/whatever through Docker3. I’m the kind of nerd who’s excitedly following FasterThanLime’s series about how Nix presumably does this better than anything else.

Yes, there’s work to do. You need a server, you need to handle its uptime and connectivity (cloud has made this effectively trivial, even more so for quick demos with things like ngrok). The app itself also needs to be written differently: updates are nontrivial, if any state is saved then backwards-compatibility becomes difficult, you need to handle different browsers (and different device types); it’s not easy. But a giant ecosystem has developed around solving these problems, and the infrastructure to use the web has become, by comparison, effectively ubiquitous.

I wasn’t too unhappy with the repetitive error handling, generics are finally coming into play, and nothing I write is anywhere near performance-critical enough for me to care about GC overhead (though I did glance firmly at the binary size once in a while). But come December, as I decided to give Advent of Code a go this year, I figured I’d try to use it to learn a new language: Rust. Now, Rust has been steadily gaining popularity for a while, but two recent events caused me to pay attention: In September, a CTO from Microsoft gave Rust a significant endorsement. In that same month, Linus Torvalds effectively announced that Rust was coming to the Linux kernel. When those two agree on something, I figured, it’s probably worth paying attention. To my delight, someone else — fasterthanlime — was doing Advent of Code in Rust. In fact, he was doing a day-by-day “let’s learn rust while solving Advent of Code” series. Part 1 includes everything you need to get started, tooling and all, and a delightfully unusual introduction to file I/O which I won’t spoil. Other ways of getting started with Rust When getting started with Rust, I tried a few things out from https://www.rust-lang.org/learn, but my recommendation is this: Before installing it, before going to the book, before any of that — go do rustlings, specifically use their Gitpod link. This will set up a free gitpod “cloud IDE” (VSCode-based), reasonably configured for Rust, and you can get right to live exercises. Having spent some time with Rust, I now see more and more faults with other programming languages. Others have written many words about this; fasterthanlime has a couple of very detailed posts in this direction; the folks at Discord wrote a great post about switching from go to rust to eliminate GC latency.

Getting code to build is much more difficult than I’m used to, but when it builds — it works. Not always, but with a much higher likelihood than I’ve seen elsewhere. To explain this phenomenon, let’s take a look at cases when data is allowed to be absent. It is often useful, in code, to deal with something that may or may not be present. I’ve recently had the unpleasant experience of dealing with soccer1 for work2; I still don’t quite get it, so this example might not make any sense, but bear with me: Let’s imagine that a soccer Team has several players (each of which is a Person with a name and age), and may or may not have a coach, who is also a Person. In JSON, that would look like this: { \"players\": [ {\"name\": \"John Doe\", \"age\": 24}, {\"name\": \"Richard Roe\", \"age\": 25} ], // Might be absent: \"coach\": {\"name\": \"Mark Moe\", \"age\": 53} } Suppose you write some code to handle such a Team, and, say, return whether or not any of the players are older than the coach.

It won’t even be a useful error message — it’ll be something like this (but probably with many more goroutines). panic: runtime error: invalid memory address or nil pointer dereference [signal SIGSEGV: segmentation violation code=0x1 addr=0x0 pc=0x480c76] goroutine 1 [running]: main.main() /tmp/sandbox3217875017/prog.go:17 +0x16 Program exited./Op The issue is that the null (well, nil) pointer is used as a way to indicate “something that is not there”, and Go — just like C — uses pointers both to indicate “we’re dealing with pointing at memory addresses” and to indicate “we’re dealing with something that may be absent”. Worse yet, because most teams do have coaches, this will be a rare case.

In day-to-day rust, indicating that a value might be absent is done using std::Option. If you were recreating the same naive approach as Go, you’d end up writing something like this: struct Team { players: Vec\u003cPerson\u003e, coach: Option\u003cPerson\u003e, } impl Team { fn any_players_older_than_coach(\u0026self) -\u003e bool { // Don't code like this, but... if self.coach.as_ref().is_none() { // This is the return false // part you will } // forget to do. let coach_age = self.coach.as_ref().unwrap().age; // ...so this part will crash: ^^^^^^^^ self.players.iter().any(|p| p.age \u003e coach_age) } } Note Yes, Rust’s support for functional-style programming blows Go’s out of the water. Yes, I’m salty. The error you’d get for forgetting to check whether coach.as_ref().is_none() is actually a bit better: thread 'main' panicked at 'called `Option::unwrap()` on a `None` value', src/main.rs:13:45 However, there’s an extremely handy smoking gun here — unwrap itself. That’s not a function that usually gets used in production3 code. A reviewer or linter should be able to catch it. The function should actually be written like this: impl Team { fn any_players_older_than_coach(\u0026self) -\u003e bool { match \u0026self.coach { None =\u003e false, Some(definitely_a_coach) =\u003e self.players.iter().any(|p| p.age \u003e definitely_a_coach.age), // definitely_a_coach can be called \"coach\" as well, // and usually would - but it's a different variable // with a different type. } } } Importantly, the type of definitely_a_coach is not Option\u003cPerson\u003e — it’s Person. That is, when using match (which is fairly standard), the guarantee that “you made sure the thing is actually there” happens at compile time. Omitting the None case is a compilation error. Note This is a great example of how Rust moves head-scratches from runtime to compile-time. It’s a big part of why it’s harder to get Rust code to build. In fact, there’s an equivalent way to write this, shorter, but providing the same safety guarantees: impl Team { fn any_players_older_than_coach(\u0026self) -\u003e bool { if let Some(definitely_a_coach) = \u0026self.coach { return self.players.iter().any(|p| p.age \u003e definitely_a_coach.age) } false // Omitting this is also a compilation error; // it won't let you forget the \"else\" case. } } Importantly, the syntax that might panic (unwrap) is quite different, easy to pick out, and does not have to be used at all. In contrast, in other languages, like Go, we don’t get the opportunity to notice that it’s happening. The coach pointer gets dereferenced using the same syntax, whether or not it’s guaranteed to not be nil.

If I were smart enough to code in Haskell, I’d be sure. One of the nice things about Rust is that it allows writing code in imperative style without understanding monads. Java Java 8 introduced java.util.Optional, which does the same thing as Rust’s Option. However, the safety guarantees are more limited: You can check ifPresent() and use get(), but this is no better than checking if a standard reference would be null (that is — nothing makes sure that you did so, and if nothing is there — get() throws an exception). Note Apparently some external inspectors do check for this, e.g. https://rules.sonarsource.com/java/RSPEC-3655 You can use orElse(defaultValue), which makes sense in some cases, but not always (what if it’s a temperature-in-celsius that might be absent? You can’t use 0° as a default value). You can use various other methods like filter and map, but that requires callback-style programming (which I don’t think is the norm for Java). At the end of the day, Java’s legacy is probably a limiting factor here — your code likely needs to interoperate with a pile of code that simply uses null the traditional way for “thing that is not there”. Finally, researching for this post showed at least one guide claiming the following as Misuse of Optional: Passing an Optional parameter to a method Having an Optional field (also discussed here), exactly as we’re doing here. …so I guess you’re stuck null-checking for those cases. C++ C++17 adds std::optional. I haven’t tried it out, but judging from a quick read, it appears to be more robust than Java’s, but still far less safe than Rust’s: You’re still checking has_value() and risking an exception when calling value() (…does your codebase even allow for exceptions?), or using value_or if a sentinel value is acceptable.

Go is often regarded as a memory-safe4 language. And that’s technically correct in this case — if you get a null dereference, your code will simply crash, as opposed to some crazy Undefined Behavior. Presumably your production setup is resilient to crashes, and you’ll catch these crashes in pre-production anyway. …except, it’ll take you a while to do that. And the crash will seem quite esoteric, and might not even happen in pre-production (does your test data contain teams without coaches?)… and, once again, if a coach-free team suddenly plays a very popular match, are you really set up to deal with such consistent crashes? It’s possible to build automatic tooling for detecting these cases, and people far smarter than myself are already doing so. Unfortunately, applying them to legacy code is an even harder. I’ve seen such a “you did not check for null” static analyzer completely miss a case quite similar to the above; and while we did catch it in pre-production, a lot of people wasted a lot of needless time on it. This is also only one (relatively-simple) example of what Rust does about safety. A more elaborate example is mutexes: A rust mutex “holds” the protected data, requiring you to lock() it to even access the data. This means that the type-system guarantees that the mutex protects whatever it’s meant to protect. In Go, however, the protected value just wears the mutex as a hat — so the compiler has no clue. (There’s at least one person porting this idea into C++) So examine your programming language; see what safety guarantees you’d like it to have (try to use the ones it already does!); and perhaps look at Rust for a bit of inspiration.

It might be because it emulates in-the-womb-noises, drowns out other noises, or gives baby something to fixate on - but it often does a great job of calming him to sleep. Nearly a year old now, he thankfully doesn’t usually need it for night sleeps, but it’s helpful for a “cranky-because-tired” nap or getting him to sleep for another half-hour when he decides to wake up very early. There are quite a few ways to play white noise, and many cheap mobile battery-powered devices will do the trick just fine. However, I wanted a bit more control, at least for when we’re at home: It’d be useful to turn on the noise remotely, as entering a cranky baby’s room sometimes riles him up. It’d be useful to (gradually!) turn off the noise remotely, especially as my wife doesn’t like the sound and it can be made worse with a baby monitor. I’d like to customize the sound itself (we’re actually going for more of a pink/brown noise) After trying out several options, I went for using a Google Home Mini; we have several of those lying around (they used to come as free gifts with various purchases), the audio quality is reasonable, and it’s compact and clean-looking. Although it does respond to a “play white noise” command, that plays this 1-hour-long segment, which is too short. Instead, I created a 10 hour version with customized parameters like so (mostly inspired here): sox -c1 -n result.ogg \\ synth 36000 brownnoise synth pinknoise \\ mix synth sine amod 0.1 90 ffmpeg -i result.ogg result.mp3 Why is the conversion to MP3 important? See quirks. The rest is a matter of hooking it up to homeassistant. The media_player.play_media service gets it to play just fine.

However, disk encryption requires a secret, and there are - generally speaking - four ways to go about that: Store the key on the same server as the encrypted disk Store the key on detachable media, attached to the same server as the encrypted disk Store the key on a different server Store the key in your brain (this is known as a “passphrase” or “password”) Using a separate server is a bit more complicated than I’d like to go (and is not always supported, e.g. in the free version of TrueNAS Core), and storing the key on the same server won’t protect me in case the server is stolen. For my usecase, it’s an easily burgler-accessible NUC. Detchable media will have to remain attached, as I want to be able to reboot remotely (I’ve heard some interesting suggestions, e.g. “store the key in a USB key glued to your desk so the burgler will probably just disconnect it from the server”). The last option is the simplest and most convenient, except when rebooting. When rebooting an encrypted system that uses a passphrase, you essentially have to do the following: Learn that a reboot is required (about once every 12 days on my server, for a kernel security update) Connect to the server to reboot it Wait for it to reboot Connect to the server again to input the passphrases I always hate actions with a “wait” part to them, so I figured - wouldn’t it be nice to input the passphrases as part of the reboot process? That way I essentially shave off steps 3 and 4. The idea is to allow just the next boot to load the encrypted bits without entering any passwords, authorized by, well, someone who knows the relevant passwords. Hopefully burglars aren’t sophisticated enough to target my machine on kernel patch days. My particular system uses ZFS-on-linux with a couple of encrypted filesystems, and the following is an implementation using systemd and Go. I do think the idea is useful enough for other passphrase-encrypted systems (e.g. LUKS). The overall design is: Before rebooting, you run the go binary on the server as root. It will: Figure out which ZFS filesystems currently have a loaded key Ask for the password for those (and check that it’s correct) Create /zfs-reboot-passphrase.sh with the passphrases embedded shellescape turns out to be useful, as fmt.Sprintf(\"%q\", password) insists on using double quotes, which doesn’t prevent bash from interpreting strings. On boot, the zfs-reboot-passphrase systemd service will check if /zfs-reboot-passphrase.sh exists and run it. It will: Load the embedded passphrases and mount the relevant filesystems shred -u itself - rewrite itself with random data to prevent undeletion, and then delete itself. The specific implementation isn’t super-clean nor important, but I’m attaching it as-is (buyer beware) for completeness.

While the Arduino is probably the best-known microcontroller, the standard one doesn’t have wifi (the one with wifi is ~$50). The ESP8266, on the other hand, is a microcontroller chip with wifi capabilities, available1 on dev boards like the NodeMCU for about $2 apiece - so I bought a few of them. The ESP8266 is sometimes used as a wifi add-on for Arduino, but it’s quite capable as a microcontroller on its own (and the newer ESP32 is faster). So what’s the difference between a (very small) computer and a microcontroller? A Raspberry Pi boots off an SD card, usually to a full-fledged Linux operating system; you’d operate it either directly with a monitor and keyboard, or connect remotely using SSH. You can install/create software on it as you would on a “full-size” computer, and I usually do this in Go (although Python is more popular). Conversely, a microcontroller will usually run only one program, which you need to build on a separate computer, connect it over USB to the microcontroller board, and flash it. This has a number of advantages, including simplicity and pretty-much-instant boot. Coding for the ESP8266 can be done using the same tooling as Arduino - namely, in C++2, on the Arduino IDE. However, during this project I learned of PlatformIO, which is far more comfortable to work with: It’s integrated into VSCode, and git, auto-formatting, autocomplete and VIM keybindings all work nicely. It also provides a more organized approach to unit testing (practically absent in Arduino IDE) and per-project dependency management (you can list what each project needs and have it auto-install). This made the project fun enough for a few iterations. One quirk of working with the BabyBuddy API is that reporting a diaper change requires supplying the time of change, even if our intention is “right now”. That’s easy enough on a Linux system, but microcontrollers don’t generally have clocks. Thankfully, libraries such as ESPDateTime provide NTP support baked right into your program. At this point, the NodeMCU version worked, and replaced the previous implementation: Poobuttons v2 - nodeMCU on breadboard Indeed, this version fits neatly onto a single (full-sized) breadboard. It’s not quite Ben Eater grade, but the NodeMCU is pretty good for breadboard mounting, and using solid-core jumpers let me make it much neater than the previous iteration. However, at this point we realized there was a missing feature: We were never quite sure if we had pressed the button, especially if we were performing a diaper change together3 . A couple of LEDs can only convey so much information. I decided to repurpose my shitty cardboard LCD case for this project. These tactile buttons have quite short feet - they don’t make it through the cardboard, and I insisted on avoiding using a perfboard and soldering iron - as, at the time, I had neither. I ultimately decided to reuse the mini-breadboard from the previous version; like many (all?) breadboards, its bottom is an adhesive pad; I didn’t even bother to remove the resistors from V1, they add a certain design flare to it. With a few iterations on the UI, it was wife-approved: Custom characters are fully supported in C++ (though, not in Go), so I got nice labels for the tactile buttons, as well as a heartbeat4 to indicate that NTP is still working. Poobuttons v3 - nodeMCU with LCD in cardboard Overall, the project has been a blast, and the result is everyday-useful.

We loved the timeline for “what happened while I as sleeping”; we loved the food amount reports; and because we had a consistent “feed, then change, then wait 15 minutes with baby upright to reduce spit-up” system, the display’s “time since last change” box was super useful as well. However, as you might imagine, we did not love handling a freshly-re-diapered baby with one hand while using the other to unlock the phone and navigate to the “yes he pooped now” page in a web app. My first idea was to create voice commands for the Nest Home Mini in the room. However, it’s prone to misunderstanding us; you have to enunciate, and even then the speech recognition is mostly tuned to preexisting Google Assistant commands, and tends to guess that we aren’t really saying words like “pee” or “poo”. Furthermore, the baby might be crying, or worse yet - lightly sleeping, at risk of being woken up by our voice (or the assistant’s). What we needed was a button (well, two - one for pee and one for poo). I had a Raspberry Pi ZeroW lying around from a previous project and decided to use it for this (the small OLED display wasn’t used for this project, but I didn’t find a good reason to take it off yet; more on that later). With bits I had from a generic “learn electronics” kit (which I bought for the specific purpose of having such bits), I created the user interface: Two buttons, a green LED for “OK”, a red LED for “something went wrong”; all tied together by some jumper cables and a mini breadboard. The Raspberry Pi would handle communicating with BabyBuddy’s API (over wifi), reading the buttons, and driving the LEDs. The setup was indeed quite similar to PiTemp’s with the software written in Go, cross-compiled, and run on startup using systemd. PooButtons on Raspberry Pi ZeroW One annoying quirk with the Raspberry Pi Zero for this is that it would register phantom button presses; they’d be quite rare, fewer than 5 a day, but that’s certainly enough to mess up diaper reporting. I’m not sure if it’s something about the particular GPIO pins I used (GPIO24, GPIO22), and disconnecting the OLED display didn’t work. I ended up following the old joke: How many software engineers does it take to change a lightbulb? None, it’s a hardware problem. How many hardware engineers does it take to change a lightbulb? None, they’ll fix it in the software drivers. Specifically it ended up looking something like this (with another goroutine listening on the resulting channel): const ( debounceTime = 2 * time.Second stableTime = 100 * time.Millisecond ) func listenButtons(ch chan\u003c- int) { pull := gpio.PullUp edge := gpio.FallingEdge level := gpio.Low for i, pin := range []gpio.PinIO{ pinButton1, // GPIO24 pinButton2, // GPIO22 } { n := i + 1 pin := pin go func() { for { time.Sleep(debounceTime) if err := pin.In(pull, edge); err != nil { log.Fatalf(\"Failed to set pin to input: %v\", err) } if pin.WaitForEdge(-1) { log.Printf(\"Got edge, waiting %v for stability\", stableTime) time.Sleep(stableTime) if pin.Read() == level { log.Print(\"Signal was stable, counting as press\") ch \u003c- n } else { log.Print(\"Signal did not remain stable, discarding\") } } else { log.Print(\"WaitForEdge returned false, ignoring\") } } }() } } It’s not ideal, but it seemed to work; certainly seemed like it should be library code, for someone smarter to debug. Indeed, it turns out that the periph.io library had a Debounce function to help with this, but at the time it wasn’t implemented at all (and now that I’ve spent some time on it, it’s partially implemented). Ultimately, the device worked rather well, and the button pushes were quite satisfying, especially after a particularly nasty diaper change (AKA a poonami).

To help overcome some of the challenges of raising a newborn, I decided to employ my standard MO - software; preferably the kind where I understand what it’s doing. It’s been working well, and I learned a lot doing it - several blog posts’ worth, in fact. For this story to make sense, it bears mentioning that our conditions are pretty much optimal for it: My employer provides a generous parental leave for the non-birth parent; we decided in advance to formula-feed, which allows us to share that load, which means we need to communicate about it; my partner is an early bird whereas I am a night-owl, meaning we essentially have separate shifts necessitating a handoff; and, critically, we’re the type of people who like everything being super-organized and scheduled and spreadsheet-y (calms us down, gives us an illusion of control). Furthermore, our baby is remarkably consistent, being hungry right about every 3 hours - so the question we ended up constantly asking (of each other and our phones) was “how long since the baby ate”. We knew in advance we’d need some sort of a baby tracking app, of which there are many. After some research, I found that few of the free ones are designed to be used from multiple devices (e.g. dad’s and mom’s phones), which is a hard requirement. We found two contenders: Baby+ and BabyBuddy.

It can track quite a few things, but not Tummy Time for one (in our case it turns out to be pretty important). Like pregnancy+, the design is very aesthetically pleasing, and it regularly shows timely, short, and useful articles for the parents. While the app does have cloud sync, it doesn’t have a web UI (it’s phone/tablet-only) nor an open HTTP API for me to reasonably code against. It does have an export function, but it’s only really intended for importing by the app itself as backup. It’s super-clunky to work with - I know because I ended up using it to perform some analysis with a spreadsheet(“how long is the baby going between feeds”). The biggest disadvantage of Baby+ is that it doesn’t really support multiple users. From the app’s internal FAQ (only available after installing it and setting up an account): How can I use this app with my partner? You can share the app by logging in with the same email and password. If you use your device and enter data (e.g. a note) then you need to minimise or close the app for it to send the new data to the server […]. Important: the app is designed to be used by on person at a a time […] otherwise data can be overwritten or deleted. […] allow a few mins for the data to sync (the second device should also have the app closed for a few mins at this point so it can fetch the data […]). Please note that you will encounter data loss if you are using the app on two devices at the same time. I’d guess that the app basically talks to the server on startup, compares timestamps of its entire database, and downloads or uploads the entire database depending on which version is newer. The startup time checks out: Starting Baby+ on an android phone, after closing it so it syncs, takes about 7 seconds; an eternity in screaming-baby-debug-time. Furthermore, that doesn’t include sync time, and old data will be shown for a few more seconds before the sync is complete; that starts off with slight frights (“the baby didn’t eat for 5 hours?! oh, wait, actually 1 hour”), and eventually devolves into distrusting the app. This felt like a silly problem to have; almost any web-based app would have none of these issues. Furthermore, I thought, there’s surely an open-source one where I could fix any annoyances I have myself. Indeed, that would be BabyBuddy.

I describe it as “the dumbest-sounding idea ever - sleep-deprived parents of newborns creating and maintaining baby-tracking software as a hobby”. It turns out to be wonderful, and is what we use today. It requires self-hosting (but provides a button to do that easily on Heroku), but works remarkably well. It didn’t work exactly like I wanted, but that just provided ample opportunity to hack on it. Before we could use it, I had to make it more mobile-friendly. While it technically worked on phones, it had several usability issues, which I described in #229: horizontal scrolling was needed in places; the “Timeline” view didn’t show a lot of the critical bits of info, requiring more clicks; the contrast was too low for sunlight; and more. Fortunately, through some wonderful collaboration from the author, I was able to quickly get it into a wife-acceptable state and transition us over from Baby+. As I hacked on the project, I added a Gitpod config and a link to the README. This allows people to hack on Babybuddy without installing any software whatsoever - everything is done through, essentially, a free tier cloud instance (on which my config will install everything needed) with a browser-builtin VSCode UI. I used this today to whip up another pull request. In addition to being quick and comfortable to use, BabyBuddy allowed me to set up two integrations that I had in mind. The first is an always-on display, essentially intended as “the baby clock”. It’s positioned by the couch where we usually feed, so it’s great as a feeding timer as well. I had started out with an old tablet (Huawei T3 Mediapad) running wallpanel - this is a form of “kiosk” application, which locks the device into a mode where it always runs the browser on a particular page (the device has no other credentials on it, so it’s reasonably safe). The tablet’s battery, unfortunately, did not like that - seemingly having the screen on discharges it faster than it can charge, and after a few weeks the tablet refused to charge at all. I’ve therefore switched to using an old ASUS C100P Chromebook running kiosk - this gives the benefit of having a physical keyboard, useful for entering the food amounts. The second integration I call “poobuttons” - a couple of tactile buttons on the changing dresser which tell BabyBuddy to mark a diaper (they are labeled “poo” and “pee”). This is both easier than fumbling with a phone touchscreen and, frankly, way more satisfying. The next posts will detail the iterations of these buttons and how I built them. This has been a wonderful and challenging journey so far. I wonder what else I’ll find myself building.

We decided to convert our spare bedroom into a home office, and I realized how nice it is to have a proper desk at home, even for non-work stuff (I haven’t had one in over 10 years!). That being said, wifi is a challenge with the apartment’s structure. (Diagram below is approximate; I’ll explain why and how it was created in a bit.) Approximate apartment structure; explanation on how and why it was created coming in a bit. My broadband comes in via a cable connection in the living room - the modem and router/AP sit in the bottom middle of the room. Before WFH times we would occasionally work from home, mostly from the living room, which was the only place with chairs. To get wifi in the bedrooms (one of which is now labeled “office”), I used a TP-link powerline pack - i.e. one thing stuck to a power socket by the router in the living room, and another in the bedroom. Or the hallway. The tradeoffs were these: We wanted to have it as close to the bedroom as possible, so we’d have good reception there. Having it in the bedroom let us hard-wire the TV to it. It’d have better performance the closer it was to the living room. While I’m not sure what the electrical topology of my apartment is, the further from the living room it got, the worse its “reception” got - i.e. the slower and less reliable its communication with the one in the living room would be. So for the most part, it worked. We’d get the odd disconnections or slowness, but it was used mostly on our phones, so we could switch wifi off (or, better yet, just go to sleep or get out of bed). There was one annoying issue though - roaming never worked right. Giving the powerline wifi network a different name worked OK, but we’d have to manually switch networks; especially on my partner’s iPhone, which tends to be “sticky” (and requires more taps to switch wifi networks to boot). Giving the powerline wifi network the same name (SSID) and password worked OK for roaming most of the time, but not always - and now it was quite difficult to tell, when a problem occurred, if it was due to our phones looking for the wrong AP; turning wifi off and on again didn’t always fix this. Working from home, connectivity suddenly became important. We have a ton of video meetings, we’re using our laptops all day, and sometimes we need to move around quickly - we can’t both have meetings in the home office, so one of us needs to switch to the living room table and have the connection work with minimal extra fiddling. I decided two get a two-pack of Nest Wifi devices (a Router and a Point). Over time, I found a third one was necessary, and still doesn’t always work quite right. Unfortunately, running ethernet to the home office isn’t currently a possibility (…but should definitely be a priority for any renovation). After some messing around, I came up with a solution, but figured I’d try and understand if I can do better by analyzing the apartment. So, step 1 - I needed a floor plan. I do not have one of my apartment, but the 3D visualization the realtor provided was still up and had a “measurement” tool. So I went to http://floorplanner.com and used that visualization to sketch up the diagram above. The point of this was the next step: In a wonderful company-internal talk about home wifi (this is a common issue in Israel, where many apartments have concrete-walled shelters), the neat mapping capability of Unifi’s controller software was shown.

At some point we converted them to what we believed to be DVD for preservation and ease-of-access, but this was actually VCD (which has somewhat worse compatibility), burned on CD-R (which degrades faster than you might think), and optical media has pretty much become extinct as well. In a family visit in 2018 I found the old stash of original video cassettes, flew them with me from Israel to Ireland, and got a local shop called DVD Centre to re-rip them - these guys provide the great service of uploading directly to Dropbox. I’ve been spending some sporadic time on weekends rewatching all of these, cataloguing them into what Googlers call a “one-pager” - a long document that may span many pages if printed out, but can be loaded by normal software with simple search functionality (a Google Doc, in my case). This is great for searching by name or event to more easily locate the right video. The tapes are still quite long though - usually 1-2 hours, and can be logically split into smaller segments. They also often have audio issues, such as audio only coming out of one side or having very inconsistent volume. For the last few weekends (2020 is a weird year that gives me more time to do this kind of thing), I’ve been working my way through the videos, correcting audio and splitting them into smaller logical chunks. I’ve uploaded them to Google Drive and shared with my family, who can now easily access them right from their phones from a different continent. It’s been bringing back many memories and feels like a worth preservation effort for these memories.

I use ffmpeg for this. The ffprobe program lets me determine the current audio type, which is aac in my case, so I do: ffmpeg -i ORIGINAL_VIDEO.mov -vn -acodec copy output-audio.aac Now I open output-audio.aac in Audacity, and perform: If only one audio stream is available, downmix stereo to mono so it at least comes out of both speakers. (Tracks -\u003e Mix -\u003e Mix Stereo down to Mono) Normalize, to get the baseline audio levels comfortable (Effects -\u003e Normalize) As a personal choice, to get the audio levels consistent, I apply extremely aggressive compression - Effects -\u003e Compressor, lowest possible threshold (-60 dB here), maximal possible ratio (10:1), attack time of 0.2 seconds and release time of 1.0 seconds. This destroys any dynamic range, but the forced consistency of audio levels helped me pick up what people are saying - they were being recorded from various distances at varying noise levels. There’s a lot more processing you can do here (graphic equalization may be a good idea), but the ones I described worked well as “catch-all” fixes that I could apply to all audio without thinking about it too much. Export this in the same audio format (again, aac in my case - I’d use ffprobe on the original to see the approximate bitrate, but it’s not necessary to match it precisely), and recombine like so: ffmpeg -i ORIGINAL_VIDEO.mov -i output-audio-fixed.aac -c:v copy -map 0:v:0 -map 1:a:0 ORIGINAL_VIDEO_sound_fixed.mov This method was both faster and more flexible than using the video editors I have at my disposable.

At this point, I watch the video through, writing down key points of what’s going on with approximate time-codes. It helps to do 3-4 different tapes of this before moving forward, as it gives you a feel for what the “logical separation” to smaller chunks is. I usually define those chunks as “different set of consecutive days” (usually just one), but it helps to have all the timecodes available in text so you don’t have to re-watch. I recommend using a player that supports faster-than-realtime viewing, such as VLC (speed up, stop on “hey what was that”, rewind, watch at regular speed). This is the most time-consuming part. After this, I decide on the section structure, and need to determine the precise frames where I want to split. Since most video players aren’t designed to “go back one frame”, I actually open the video in a video editor (the free HitFilm Express, in my case). I start with the rough time-codes from the previous step, and step frame-by-frame back-and-forth until I find the first and last usable frames of a section. I write these to a points.txt file with the following syntax: 00:00:00:00-00:15:48:13 00:15:50:17-00:40:14:01 ... Here, the format is Hour:Minute:Second:Frame - in my case the video is 25 FPS, so Frame is between 00 and 24. Next, I want to split the video using ffmpeg - this can be done without recoding, which is much faster (on my laptop - a few seconds per section, as opposed to multiple minutes) and doesn’t degrade quality. For the timecodes above, the correct split commands are: ffmpeg -ss 0:00:00.000 -i audio_corrected.mov -to 0:15:48.520 -c copy segment_1.mov ffmpeg -ss 0:15:50.680 -i audio_corrected.mov -to 0:24:23.360 -c copy segment_2.mov These are annoying to create manually, because: The timecode for ffmpeg is given in milliseconds, so 13 frames in 25fps becomes 520 milliseconds. The -to offset is from the section’s start (so it’s more of a -length), and subtraction is hard. So, of course, I wrote some code to do this for me. It takes a points.txt as described above, and outputs the appropriate series of commands. All that’s left to do is to let the commands run, upload the videos, and wait for Google Drive’s video-rendering to catch up. Good luck on your video preservation adventure!

This belief is fed by the illusion of control, which has us overestimating the importance of conscious actions of people as reasons for things that happen, and underestimating blind luck and circumstances that are outside the control of those involved. The truth is that many things happen for no reason, by chance. A commander might make all the correct decisions in battle, but still lose due to an error in judgement by his superiors or subordinates. A businessperson might make the worst possible decisions, and still turn a profit because the entire field of his business has had an impressive profit surge due to an external reason, or because a competitor went bankrupt. A minister can make correct decisions that would only affect the following term of office, and be criticized for decisions made by his predecessor or a global economic crisis outside of their control. Therefore, in many cases the best managers, politicians and commanders (and anyone else who manages anything) are those who excel at the following task: Make the bad things that happened during their shift look like someone else’s fault, as external circumstances outside their control or bad luck, and make the good things that happened during their tenure look like they happened thanks to them. Truly, many of the managers I’ve met are experts in this matter - the ass-covering ability. Ass-covering is far more than military slang intending to describe amusing phenomena. Ass-covering is the way a world works when there’s uncertainty about people’s ability to properly perform their job; when there’s no way to accurately measure the output of most people in most professions, especially higher-ranking ones, and it’s impossible to separate individual contributions from external influences. Ass-covering is the way our world works. Many things which seem as though they shouldn’t exist in a logical world with rational humans have their roots in ass-covering. For example, recruitment screening agencies. If there are ten measures of stupidity in the business world, recruitment screening agencies have taken at least eight upon themselves1. Upon first exposure to the phenomenon, people are astounded by its scope, the superficiality of the tests and interviews, and the cheap psychology behind the whole matter. The truth is that recruitment screening agencies exist for a very good reason: it’s difficult to find good employees. People (especially those who read my post on the matter) don’t represent themselves fairly during job interviews, school grades don’t accurately predict the required traits for an excellent employee, and ultimately hiring a new employee is always a wager. And once there’s uncertainty, ass-covering slithers its way in. When an HR officer at a certain company needs to hire new people, they can make this wager themselves, or they can send them to one of the recruitment screening agencies. There, the potential employees will pass a variety of tests which, as is known for decades, predict next-to-nothing; they will be asked to draw trees in order to see that they draw pretty and optimistic trees; to fill in blanks such as “the child was sad when …” (recommended: “when an analyst at the recruitment screening agency decided he wasn’t a good fit for the job, and he was forced to kill them”), et cetera. If the candidates turn out to be bad employees, the HR officer can always say “they passed ScreenAgent”. It isn’t their responsibility.

These get a func() callback, capture whatever it outputs to stdout and stderr, and return them as a string. The Capture function only works with pure Go code, and CaptureWithCGo is meant to support code that includes CGo as well. The latter assumes that the CGo code would use the C stdout and stderr globals (which are FILE * pointers which are used by printf and fprintf), so it creates a pipe and points stdout and stderr at it. This has two problems: Assigning to stdout and stderr is no longer allowed in Go 1.10 (and, according to golang/go#25221, was never intentionally allowed). Functions could output to standard output and error in other ways, such as calling external programs or using the write system call. This is true for the Capture function as well, but I wanted to modify as little behavior as possible. Technically, the behavior-preserving solution could be to just use freopen instead, but I didn’t know about it at the time. In general, capturing output using redirects seems to me like it should capture all output, regardless of how it’s generated. To accomplish this, let’s first have a look a how shells accomplish redirects. $ strace -f bash -c '/bin/echo hello \u003e /tmp/redirected' ... [pid 20210] openat(AT_FDCWD, \"/tmp/redirected\", O_WRONLY|O_CREAT|O_TRUNC, 0666) = 3 [pid 20210] dup2(3, 1) = 1 [pid 20210] close(3) = 0 [pid 20210] execve(\"/bin/echo\", [\"/bin/echo\", \"hello\"], 0x556c1736e260 /* 30 vars */) = 0 ... Here, strace runs a parent bash process (pid 20209, not shown in the trace above), which forks into PID 20210 which ultimately ends up running /bin/echo (and not the echo bash builtin). To accomplish the redirect, bash does the following: Open the requested file, which ends up being file descriptor 3. Use the dup2 system call to overwrite file descriptor 1 (standard output) with the same file descriptor as 3. Now this open file has two descriptors pointing at it. Close file descriptor 3; this reduces the number of file descriptors pointing at /tmp/redirected back to one. Finally, uses execve to replace the running program with /bin/echo, which will (as always) output to file descriptor 1, which now points to /tmp/redirected. No matter how echo internally causes output to appear (even if it ran yet another binary), the output would always go to /tmp/redirected. It’s worth mentioning that the dup system call is similar to the dup2 system call, but the caller doesn’t choose the destination file descriptor; instead, the first available file descriptor is used and returned. This technique is the basic one behind the fix. The old method was, roughly: Save the old os.Stdout, os.Stderr, C.stdout, and C.stderr objects Open a pipe - this gets you two file descriptors (w.Fd() and r.Fd()) Point the Go objects os.Std{out,err} at w.Fd() by just assigning w to them Point the C objects C.std{out,err} at w.Fd() by opening it with fdopen and assigning the result to them. (This no longer works) Call the callback function Copy from the r end of the pipe to a buffer using io.Copy. When the method returns (using defer), restore the four objects we saved The new technique is, roughly: Use syscall.Dup to save file descriptors 1 and 2 (standard output and error) Open the pipe as before Use syscall.Dup2 to overwrite file descriptors 1 and 2 with w.Fd() When the method returns, restore the original file descriptors Call the callback function Close all instances of the w end of the pipe Copy from the r end of the pipe to a buffer using io.Copy. WHen the method returns, restore the original file descriptors 1 and 2 When closing all instances of the w end of the pipe, this means w.Fd(), syscall.Stdout, and syscall.Stderr. If any of those three stays open, the underlying file descriptor will still count as open, and io.Copy will never return.

If the assumption turns out to be true, it “works”; if the customer notices and appeals the charge - it “doesn’t work”, and the company will correct the charge, with barely any damage (e.g. public relations damage). The constant rule of this method, from which it gets is name, is “if it works - it works; if it doesn’t work - it doesn’t work”; in other words, there’s a chance the attempt will succeed, and conversely, little to no damage will happen if it won’t, so there’s nothing to lose and it’s worth trying. The Matzliah method occurs in other fields as well: A business-owner that doesn’t pay their employees the full wage and benefits they deserve Litigation intended to intimidate into settlement, such as vexatious litigation. A business-owner deducts taxes for expenses, when they are unsure if the expenses are deductible or not. If the IRS does not review this business, it works. If a review occurs, they will remove the deduction. A failing politician is called to resign, but does not hurry to do so, assuming that the public is otherwise occupied. If the public notices, the politician can always resign. An insurance company dismisses a claimant’s demand for payment with various claims, such as contradicting with the terms of the policy. If the claimant does not respond nor refer to the courts, the insurance company profits (due to non-payment). If the claimant does refer to the courts, the insurance company will offer to settle for a partial sum, hoping that the claimant, due to pressure and interest in shortening legal proceedings, will agree to it. The insurance company will, at most, pay part of the policy’s sum. (See Insurance bad faith). In The Rainmaker, a young lawyer called Rudy Baylor deals with an insurance company operating with the Mazliah method: it would initially deny every insurance claim submitted, and only pay claimants that continued to fight for their rights. A softer version of the Mazliah version is “at least we tried”, or “can’t blame us for trying”. In this version, an attempt is made to gain an advantage, but not necessarily with fair means. For example, haggling by presenting unreasonably extreme opening positions.

At some point she needed to run an experiment in the field of perception. While the exact form of the experiment was pending professor vetting, she did know that the experiment will take place with a user sitting in front of a desktop computer, responding to various stimuli, often with the reaction time being recorded. Seeing as programming is not in her faculty’s curriculum (a mistake, in my opinion), the students are provided with a faculty programmer. Dozens of students would contact this jaded craftsman, describe what they need, wait patiently, and then - as it happens in the world of software - receive something almost, but not quite, entirely unlike what they asked for. I was all too happy to help (and owe Sharon an insurmountable number of favors to start with), but had nothing to start with at the time. The weeks and months passed, I was deep into my move and training at my new job1, and happily suggesting (using my limited understanding of psychology) experiments. When the final proposal was authorized, the timing was inconvenient - I was going on a business trip to California the next day, putting a 10 hour time difference between Sharon and myself. No matter. The experiment was fairly well-defined before I left - a word out of three word-sets, designated as “up”, “down” and “neutral”, was to flash in the middle of the screen, and then a circle would appear at the top or bottom. The user had to react to this circle as quickly as possible, and the idea was to test whether or not a word from the “up” category (such as “sky” or “cloud”) would correlate with better reaction time when the circle appeared at the top, and vice versa. There were some other details such as “catch trials” when no circle would show up at all, but it sounded fairly simple. (Keep reading for a demo!)

Sharon and I agreed that, while this seems completely reasonable and quite thought-out, we would work in an iterative fashion, and have regular video-chats on what should be done next. Also, to simplify things, I asked to create the software as a web page intended for use on Chrome, rather than Matlab as suggested by her faculty programmer (who seemed convinced, for whatever reason, that Matlab could give better timing precision - this turned out to be false). She agreed, and within a few hours on a plane, I had a basic draft working. I emailed Sharon a copy of the draft; it was split into a simple index.html file, a style.css file, a seaplane.js code file, and a config.js code file. That last split was deliberate: Sharon, who has no experience in coding (and even claims to be a technophobe), could modify clearly defined configuration (including the sets of words and tuned delays) with no anxiety of “messing up” the more complex code. Soon enough, timezones flipped by, and Sharon was happy enough with the result to respond with a modified config.js file, and a list of changes she wanted - mostly present in the original requirements, but some which could only be understood while trying out the first draft. Naturally, some of the changes would require the syntax of config.js itself to change, and Sharon had more data to add to it. To avoid seaplane7-final-really.zip email attachments flying back and forth, version control would be required. Using Github would facilitate this, and also allow us to use its Issues mechanism for tracking remaining work. It took a few minutes over the phone to explain the basic concept of version control to Sharon, as well as how to create a Github account, modify files using the web-based interface, report and comment on issues. While I did mention Github for Windows as an option, I didn’t pressure Sharon into using it, especially as I wasn’t familiar enough with it myself. Over 10 days and 48 commits (27 mine, 20 Sharon’s) we got the code working well enough to run the experiment. There were a few reported bugs, but nothing substantial that skewed the results, as far as we can tell. You’re welcome to see a Demo of Seaplane, as well as browse the Seaplane source code.

They keep showing up in git status. What to do? You can create a file called .gitignore - note that the filename starts with a ., which is standard for configuration files in Unix and causes them to be hidden from normal listing. Each .gitignore file affects the current directory and its subdirectories - you can have multiple .gitignore files to create more specific rules for subdirectories. Note: .gitignore can only be used for files which shouldn’t be in source code at all (those show up as “Untracked files”. Modified files can’t be ignored in this way.

(Interestingly enough, on newer Ubuntu releases this isn’t PID 1…), so the script doesn’t have any child processes by the time it prints “Bye”. After “Bye” is shown, the script exits immediately, returning control to the shell. Now, call the script pied_piper.sh, and try the following: ./pied_piper.sh | cat ./pied_piper.sh | ts # Awesome timestamping utility, same problem though ssh localhost ./pied_piper.sh Annoying, isn’t it? These commands won’t finish for 20 seconds! The problem is that sleep is keeping its stdout open, which is the input pipe for cat, ts, ssh, or whatever else you’re piping to (this is very annoying on Jenkins jobs as well). If a third-party product is pissing you off this way - that is, it died, but somehow still keeps its pipe open, you can find the culprit like so: fuser -v /proc/$PID_OF_PROCESS_WITH_OPEN_PIPE/fd/0 This will usually yield a sleep process as the culprit, with the useless parent information of init (as per my example). The only information you have is the precise delay - in my experience, it helps to find all “sleep” commands lurking about, and tinker with the delay amounts: Found a sleep 30? Change it to sleep 29, see if that’s what shows up. Here’s how to actually fix the problem: #!/bin/bash ( sleep 20 \u003e\u0026- 2\u003e\u0026- \u003c\u0026- \u0026 ) ps -f $(pidof sleep) echo \"Bye\" This will close stdout, stderr and stdin. As a friend pointed out, it’s often safer to do \u003e /dev/null rather than \u003e\u0026-, as some processes will crap out if they don’t have some semblence of an stdout. However, \u003e\u0026- is shorter, faster, and perfectly safe for sleep. Of course, it’s better to save the PID for this sleep and kill it when appropriate from within the script - otherwise, you might be accumulating many useless sleep processes.

Anyone watching a show and failing to immediately catch up to the latest episode will see a lot of posts on their feed dancing around the spoiler, and finally revealing it completely. This makes sense - people like to talk about their favorite shows, and social networks are a great place to do it. What I’d like to suggest is a mechanism for mitigating the spoiler problem. This mechanism is optimized for Facebook, but could easily be applied to Google+, Twitter et cetera. The short version: Mark potential spoilers, keeping track of what exactly they might be spoiling Allow voluntary marking by the original poster Allow reporting of spoilers, similarly to spam reports Collapse spoiler materials, showing what is being spoiled Allow users to view spoilers When they do this, optionally “learn” that these spoilers can now safely be shown. For an example, consider the following scenario: I’m watching the fantastic show Game of Scones, and in the latest episode - season 4, episode 3 - Lord Muffin has been surprisingly murdered. I might want to post the following status: OMG can’t believe Lord Muffin was murdered no waayyyyyy Now, one of the following happens: Before posting, I check a box saying “this status contains spoilers”, clearly indicating Game of Scones S04E03. I post without checking the box, ticking off my spoiler-sensitive friends. Several unfriend me, but a few of them hit the “Spoiler alert” button adjacent to the post. Bonus points: The social network platform automatically recognizes the spoiler and asks me to mark it. Once the post was marked, it looks like this: Spoiler to Game of Scones S04E03 hidden. Click to unhide Clicking the “click to unhide” link should, naturally, show the status as it was originally posted. However, the social network can be smarter about this, and remember that as of now - spoilers to S04E03 are OK, and shouldn’t be hidden from the user. A few notes about this: This shouldn’t be done automatically, and a confirmation should be shown - at least at first (“Should spoilers for this episode still be hidden? Show Spoilers/Keep hiding spoilers”) Posts containing spoilers should have a small visual indicator of them being as such. This is a good hint for what other people are seeing, and assists helpful users in marking spoilers. It would be useful to allow searching for spoilers - for example, if I just saw the episode and want to see what people are saying about it. Finally, this is a neat signal that can be used by whatever social network implements it - imagine, a percentage graph of “how many people have already watched the latest episode”. Seeing as many people Tivo or torrent episodes, that kind of data has got to be worth some money to someone. Note that there are existing spoiler prevention mechanisms implemented as browser extensions, and what I’m suggesting is more complex and requires integration into the social network itself. This is important anyway, as you want the social network to work the same on any device or browser. Unfortunately, this also means that I am currently powerless to implement it. So if you think this is a good idea and know someone relevant, pass it along!

I’m curious as to which will happen first: NetFlix hits Israel, or I switch over to Sick Beard. At any rate, nowadays I use flexget, transmission, tvnamer and xbmc, held together with some bash scripts. On debian- and ubuntu-based systems, the transmission daemon runs as a separate user (debian-transmission), so this requires a bit of care with file and group ownership. After rebuilding my system, I couldn’t get tvnamer to work right for some reason, no matter how careful I was. I’d keep getting this error: Loading config: config.json #################### # Starting tvnamer # Found 1 episode #################### # Processing file: Sherlock.S03E01.mkv # Detected series: Sherlock (season: 3, episode: 1) #################### Old filename: Sherlock.3x01.The.Empty.Hearse.720p.HDTV.x264-FoV.mkv New filename: Sherlock - [03x01] - The Empty Hearse.mkv New path: /home/debian-transmission/inbox/Sherlock - [03x01] - The Empty Hearse.mkv Creating directory /home/debian-transmission/inbox rename Sherlock.3x01.The.Empty.Hearse.720p.HDTV.x264-FoV.mkv to /home/debian-transmission/inbox/Sherlock - [03x01] - The Empty Hearse.mkv OSError(1, 'Operation not permitted') New path: /media/Store/shows/Sherlock/Season 3/Sherlock.3x01.The.Empty.Hearse.720p.HDTV.x264-FoV.mkv Creating directory /media/Store/Shows/Sherlock/Season 3 OSError(2, 'No such file or directory') For a few weeks I’d double-check the permissions, fail to understand what was going on, groan and copy the files manually. The new Sherlock episode had me in a bit of a more investigative mood. This turns out to be an exercise in confusing OS logic and logging. It looks like the rename operation failed, and somehow the directory creation failed as well. Neither is the case. A hint can be found in the precise error after the rename: “1 - Operation not permitted” (that’s EPERM). If that seems a bit off, that’s because it is: When renames fail because of inadequate permissions, they return EACCES “13 - Permission denied”. So what’s going on? It turns out that after renaming, tvnamer tries to preserve the access and modification times of renamed files. A noble cause, but it turns out that Linux won’t allow this unless you are the owner of the file - even if you do have write permissions. Therefore, this fails, which causes tvnamer to believe the rename failed - although it hasn’t. Afterwards, the directory is created (this succeeds), but since tvnamer tries to copy using the old filename (thinking the rename failed), we get an ENOENT “2 - No such file or directory” error about the source of the copy operation. The fix can be found in this pull request. Happy bug hunting!

Back in Introduction to Systems Programming (a second-semester course revolving around abstract data types in C, introduction to C++, and hands-on experience building multi-module C programs), most homework exercises looked something along these lines: Write a program managing a store inventory, with a command-line client conforming to a given set of specifications. For an input file looking like this: addcategory Fruit addproduct Fruit Banana 2.30 addproduct Fruit Tomato 1.20 addproduct Fruit Apple 1.50 addproduct Fruit Apple 1.60 list Fruit The output file would be expected to look like this: OK OK OK OK ERROR Duplicate fruit Apple Fruit ----- Apple 1.50 Banana 2.30 Tomato 1.20 Of course, error messages, sorting and spacing for the output would be part of the spec. That provided an effective way of checking your program’s correctness: Run it on a given input, and compare its output - using diff - to expected output. Some TAs even provided simple test files (input + expected output) for this exact method (but not revealing the “real” test files which would they use while grading), but the “serious” tests happened in the student-run “homework help” forum (ah, phpbb…), where students would regularly place gargantuan test files to compare your program against (these were very helpful in finding memory handling errors). For an advanced technique, I wrote a “reference” implementation in Python (this is much shorter than the C version, and probably less bug-prone). I then generated random input files, fed them into both programs, and whenever the output would differ between the two - I’d found in a bug (in one of the versions). I recall a certain student festival, a friend ran up to me, and exclaimed: “I’m totally wasted. I’ve had no sleep for the past two days, but I’ve finally finished the exercise. diff [outputs] 0 [lines of difference]! Whoo!” He ran off at this point. What does all of this have to do with test-driven development? It became “known” that it’s better to start the exercises later, so that early-bird students will have test data up on the forum before you start. Then, just code until the tests pass. Ah, the excuses we students come up with for procrastination… I’ve been striving to do test-driven development ever since, with the help of proper unit testing frameworks, and it’s hard for me to think of having ever coded without it. There are plenty of resources online explaining why unit-testing is such a helpful idea… all I’m saying is that you might already be testing your code, not realizing that a nice framework can help.

Writing, for me, is usually about practical stuff. Sometimes it’s simply code (most of those projects were written on vacations). Other times, it’s writing to this blog (in one of its incarnations) - which usually has to do with technical tinkering of some sort or other. It’s not that I don’t do enough writing in my day job; but there does tend to be an accumulation of things to write: “I should blog about that”, “I should write that code”, “I should try and get my router to do that”, and so forth.

I’ve learned quite a bit from it, and had a chance to use a few of my favorite technologies. The project was coded in Python, which is not my favorite programming language - Ruby is. However, since Python is more popular at my workplace, and seems to have a richer ecosystem around it (sometimes, at any rate), I’ve grown to love it almost as much over the years. It’s quick, easy, and has fantastic libraries; specifically, for this project, we made heavy use of the Natural Language Toolkit. We used Git for source control and Github for hosting, Travis for continuous integration, and ReadTheDocs for documentation. All of these culminate in the project being handed in as a single link: http://github.com/lutzky/translationese. The translationese project is a re-implementation of the concepts presented in “On The Features Of Translationese”, an article describing an attempt to automatically distinguish between texts written in English originally, and texts translated to English from a different language. Since this turned to be an easy problem, the focus was to determine what specific features of a given text are better at distinguishing between the two categories. Why reproduce results from an existing article? Well, beyond academic points, we wanted to provide well-documented, easily-extensible, tested code. The article was not always clear on specific definitions of various features; Python code makes these completely explicit, in a relatively readable way (for code, at any rate). To keep code quality high, we used test-driven development: each feature was coded only after a (failing) unit test for it was written. This helped keep the code modular, and made refactoring (which happened quite a bit) easy and safe. The resulting design proved to be quite flexible, as I will shortly explain. SVM is a form of machine learning. Simply put, it’s a method of teaching a machine to distinguish between two categories of “points” (in our case, “translated” and “original”). The SVM is given two such sets, and tries to draw a “line” (or, generally, a hyperplane) separating them. Afterwards, it should be able to classify new points (without being told which set they belong to) by which side of the line they are. The following image (Wikipedia) shows a simple, two-dimensional case (the red line properly distinguishing the two sets): For our case, each “property” took a block of text, and translated it to an n-dimensional point. For some properties, the dimension was quite extreme. For example, the property of character trigrams gives each coordinate the value of “how many times does each permutation of three consecutive letters appear in the text”. There are 17,576 such permutations, so each text became a point in a 17,576-dimensional space. These points were fed into an SVM algorithm implemented in Weka. During the final presentation of the project, we explained that the particularly high-dimensionality properties proved to be too much for Weka (it would use up all available RAM), so smaller sample sizes were used for those. However, we were told that using sparse vector representation as Weka’s input could allow it to be more efficient. Fortunately, our design proved to be robust enough that I could implement (and test) the change during the presentation (1278645). Indeed, we now had no problems with the high-dimensionality properties, and repeated our runs, updating the documentation (after we were given our grade…) There’s a somewhat eerie aspect to this project. Having used SVM, I have no idea how it works. While I know exactly how my Python code works, and exactly what the SVM algorithm does, I still don’t know how to tell a translated text from one written in English originally.

Your public key has been saved in /home/tactless/.ssh/id_rsa.pub. The key fingerprint is: 5a:3a:e3:f4:6e:91:fe:3f:27:4e:f4:46:0d:5e:50:4f tactless@dolphin Now you have a public and private key: ~/.ssh/id_rsa is the private key (don’t give this to anyone!), and ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub is the public key - give this to everyone. Specifically, put it on the SSH server you want to log into, making sure the permissions are correct. There’s a script which does this: ssh-copy-id t2.technion.ac.il It basically does the following for you: $ scp ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub t2.technion.ac.il: password: $ ssh t2.technion.ac.il \u003e mkdir .ssh \u003e cat id_rsa.pub \u003e\u003e .ssh/authorized_keys \u003e chmod 700 .ssh .ssh/authorized_keys \u003e chmod 755 . \u003e logout Now, when you log in to your local account, before using SSH for the first time, type the following command: $ ssh-add Enter passphrase for /home/tactless/.ssh/id_rsa: your-password-here $ ssh t2.technion.ac.il \u003e # notice, didn't type a password \u003e logout $ ssh t2.technion.ac.il \u003e # no password this time either ","date":"2013-03-23","objectID":"/linux-stuff/ssh-public-key-authentication/:0:0","tags":null,"title":"SSH public key authentication","uri":"/linux-stuff/ssh-public-key-authentication/"},{"categories":null,"content":"I’ve already mentioned my show downloading stack on this blog. It’s changed a bit since - I now use Transmission rather than rtorrent, as it has the excellent transmission-daemon package which has it acting exactly the way I like (without using screen).

So while this may be how TV works for you: Notice that a new episode is out Torrent it Wait for the download to finish Watch it …this is how TV works for me now: Receive E-mail notification of a new downloaded episode Watch it Here’s how it’s done: First, write /usr/local/bin/notify_torrent_done: #!/bin/bash cat_the_message() { cat \u003c\u003cEOF Subject: Torrent done: $TR_TORRENT_NAME Hello from transmission $TR_APP_VERSION at $(hostname).

We rerun msmtp until it succeeds because you will often get a “connection timed out” response from gmail (…at least on my ISP…).

I highly recommend using Google’s two-step authentication, which will have you creating a one-time password for each application - use one of those one-time passwords here. Finally, in /etc/transmission-daemon/settings.json, add the following code: \"script-torrent-done-enabled\": true, \"script-torrent-done-filename\": \"/usr/local/bin/notify_torrent_done\", Important: You need to run /etc/init.d/transmission-daemon reload at this point, not restart - that would cause settings.json to be rewritten from runtime configuration.

Source control is super important. Mistakes will be made, other coders will want to join in, and experimental features will want to be in their own branches. Git is awesome; it does source control right, gives me powerful tools, and isn’t a hassle to set up - even for a small project like this. Github is also awesome; it makes collaboration with other coders - even just one, in my case - easy, organized, and fun. One of my favorite git features is revert. It allows you to automatically inverse a previous change. Here’s an example from TransportDroidIL: 0e194de. This commit reverts a previous “cleanup” commit in the autocompletion code - allegedly, I was keeping two copies of the autocompletion option list for no reason: One as a LinkedList\u003cstring\u003e, and one internal to the AutoCompleteTextView which I can access via an ArrayAdapter\u003cstring\u003e. Turns out that my LinkedList\u003cstring\u003e copy is necessary, because the ArrayAdapter\u003cstring\u003e always behaves as though it’s empty, so it cannot truly be read from. Despite having performed a few commits since that bad “fix”, git was very helpful in letting me revert that particular change, showing me the conflicts this operation causes, and allowing me to fix them. The lesson is an important one: Make small, manageable commits. Git is optimized for this, as commits are local (no need to contact the server until a push). Developing for Android makes a lot of sense when using Eclipse. I’m a VIM junkie, and generally dislike IDEs. Eclipse is slow and heavy - but it gets the job done, and it does it very well. It’s a bit weird that a plugin is required to manage color schemes - but it exists. It’s very weird (and quite annoying) that it doesn’t remove end-of-line white-space, and doesn’t have an option to do this. This makes git complain. There is an option to add “clean-up” settings which are activated on every save, but this is far too cumbersome and might change code I didn’t intend to change (which becomes confusing in the revision log). Still, the excellent debugging, JUnit and logcat support are worth it. Logcat is another awesome feature of Android. Every logged line has both a “Tag” (usually defined per-class) and a severity. Logs can be filtered with a different severity for each tag, and still - one can use the same logcat to show messages from anything running on the Android device at the moment. It’s basically Syslog done better. One last point is about Hebrew. This has been a problem with Android for quite a while; for example, in a stock Android 2.3.3, numbers embedded in Hebrew string appear backwards. Fixes exist, and are implemented in most Israeli ROMs, especially the ones distributed by phone carriers - but they’re different, and sometimes don’t work for all applications. This causes numbers to appear backwards in TransportDroidIL, which in turn caused me to implement an ugly hack. I hope the upcoming Ice Cream Sandwich release fixes this.

I love being able to communicate textually with friends, coworkers and family. It’s ideal for a noisy pub; a somewhat-private conversation on a crowded bus; telling something to someone who may be asleep, so they see it first thing when they wake up; making quick responses while in a meeting without being rude (well, at least at my workplace it’s considered perfectly acceptable). It’s also very handy when you want to tell someone something they ought to write down, such as a phone number or something they should remember to buy. My problem isn’t with the concept of mobile textual messaging - it’s with SMS, the “Short Message Service”, as provided by Israeli carriers (and possibly worldwide). The first problem I’d like to discuss is length. SMS messages are limited to 160 characters, or rather - 160 bytes. If your message includes any foreign characters, such as Hebrew letters, then UTF-16 mode takes effect, and your message is limited to 70 characters, which is ridiculously short. While the name of the service, SMS, implies that the messages should indeed be short, this is not the only common usage: If you want to have an actual conversation with someone (and this is a perfectly reasonable situation), messages will be longer than 160 characters, and certainly longer than 70. The problem becomes worse if u dont want to use shorthands n skip punctuations like many smsers do. (Ever found yourself about to send a 75-character message, going over it to find 5 characters to trim without looking like an idiot?) There have been several attempts to overcome the short-message problem, all of them implemented as workarounds in cellphone software. The initial, primitive approach was to simply split a message up into appropriately-sized chunks, and send out those chunks as separate messages: A 150-character Hebrew message would be sent out as 3 separate messages (70, 70, 10 characters respectively). Later on, a mechanism was invented for the phones to detect the split messages, stitch them back up on the recipient’s phone, and notify the recipient if the message is incomplete. Poor man’s TCP. The split-message solution is very problematic, especially when taking into account two other problems with SMS: Reliability and price. The reliability problem is subtle: SMS message usually make it across, but when they don’t (and sometimes, in fact, they don’t), no notification is given. Where E-mail servers notify you about delivery failure, where instant messaging services tell you that the other party has disconnected, SMS has… nothing. There’s no way to know that your message hasn’t been received, unless a little-known, not-supported-everywhere and highly annoying “read receipt” feature is enabled. The price problem is completely absurd: I have a small 1GB plan at Orange, which costs 70₪/month. That’s 70 NIS / 1GB, 1GB being 109 bytes. That comes to 7 \u0026times 10-6 Agorot per byte. Suppose that an SMS-style service would need a bloated 100-byte header, so an SMS message is 260 bytes. Therefore, an SMS message should cost 0.00182 Agorot. In reality, it costs 44 Agorot (inter-carrier average) without a plan, or 14 Agorot (at best, requiring a 1000-SMS plan) with a plan. That’s between 7692× and 24176× as much. One additional problem with SMS is the fact that they’re locked into your device. Got a new phone? You have to go through a very complicated process to transfer your SMS messages over, and this isn’t possible for every phone. Lost your old phone? Unless you were backing up manually, your messages are gone. Have a separate work-phone? You’ll need to use each phone to see messages sent specifically to it. None of these problems occur with an online E-mail provider, why should they happen with mobile texting? With modern phones, sending and receiving E-mail is just as easy as sending and receiving SMS messages. The main problem is that not everyone has a modern phone, and E-mail on older phones is quite cumbersome.

First order of business - get a working internet connection. This is extra-challenging when your primary machine doesn’t even have a wireless network card. My first hack used my trusty laptop - it has a properly working wireless card, and could connect to my roommate’s router quite easily. It runs Ubuntu, and as it turns out, that means sharing the connection was dead-simple: Right-click on the network manager icon, add a new wired connection called “Shared”, and under IPv4 settings, choose “Shared to other computers”. That’s it. Once I connected my desktop to my laptop, it automatically got all of its settings, and I was good to go. However, this was kind of annoying - I had to leave my laptop on, the reception in my room isn’t perfect so it would sometimes disconnect (requiring manual intervention), and my laptop wasn’t free for ordinary use (if I wanted my torrents to keep going). The solution: I grabbed my (horrible) old D-Link DIR-300 router, and installed DD-WRT on it. This gave it an awesome “client mode” feature, which allowed it to use it the same way I used my laptop to bridge my wireless connection. Flashing it worked quite well by following the guide (the updated version in the wiki, that is - it has proper instructions for connecting to RedBoot, the D-Link flashing interface, from Linux), and another guide helped me set up Client mode. All seems well, except for two issues: First, port forwarding doesn’t seem to work properly - it works well on the internal network (that is, I can SSH into my desktop using my laptop), but not on the internet (SSH port shows up as open, but I can’t connect). I’m also guessing that UPnP/NAT-PMP won’t work properly. Second, and this is an old problem - the router has a high-pitched whine. This may have something to do with the fact that the AC/DC adapter it came with is rated for 12V @ 1A, whereas the router is rated 5V @ 1.2A. Let’s hope it doesn’t fry (hasn’t for the 3 years I used it).

Here’s how to get around that: First, a few downloads. You’ll need: The android emulator (presumably you already have this, if not, you can get it at developer.android.com) The hebdroid fonts unyaffs, which will extract the system.img file A snapshot of yaffs2, which will create our new system.img file. This is actually today’s snapshot from the git repository, which worked for me. For later versions, take a look at the git repository. Building unyaffs is simple enough, or you can use the prebuilt version from the site. Building mkyaffs2image is also quite easy - just untar the snapshot, and run make in the utils directory. Put both of these utilities somewhere in your $PATH for convenience. Now we can get to work. First, locate your system.img file. It should be within your Android SDK directory, under platforms/android-3/images (or whatever version you’re emulating). We’ll extract that - create a temporary directory, say /tmp/system.img.hebdroid, and cd to it. Then run: unyaffs /path/to/system.img The whole /system filesystem should be extracted. Now extract the ttf files from hebdroid.zip into the fonts directory, replacing the original font files. To pack everything back up, run: mkyaffs2image /tmp/system.img.hebdroid system.img.hebdroid Now, I recommend putting renaming your original system.img to system.img.orig, and using symlinking system.img.hebdroid as your new system.img (the emulator does indeed follow symlinks), but you can basically do whatever you like.

I’ve recently “bought” a Samsung Galaxy Android phone (the older i7500, not the newer i9000 “S”) model. It’s a seriously serious upgrade from my old Nokia 6120 Classic, and as I broke the 6120’s screen and reverted back to my trusty old Nokia 6070 (which I couldn’t even get to run the GMail app), I was quite a happy camper switching to a modern phone. The whole idea of Android has always been very appealing to me - Nokia’s software has been declining in quality, and while Motorola and Samsung have always made excellent hardware, they could never get the knack of good software. Google has. Problem solved, right? The Android software is miles ahead of anything I’ve ever seen, including iPhone. I now have connectivity everywhere, and apps to sync all of my favorite things - GMail and Google Calendar are included, GTasks is great for tasks, Paperdroid is great for Read It Later, NewsRob is great for Google Reader. The Facebook and Twidroyd applications are also quite nice, and the convenience has me using those networks more. I even have nifty stuff like Transdroid, a Transmission web client which is actually very good at adding torrents while I’m away, so they’re done by the time I get home. I get my reading done with Aldiko and ACV (for comics). Even Israeli sites have some good applications up, such as YNet and Dapei Zahav have a nice Android app, though not as nice as their iPhone ones. And of course, there’s the wonderful Waze, which is the most Israeli solution to the road congestion problem I’ve ever seen. I’ve even had the chance to do some on-foot navigation with Google Maps, which is also handy. The phone itself has a beautiful AMOLED screen, great audio quality (comes with quite a good set of headphones as well), and looks sleek. The touchscreen is responsive enough (though not anywhere near new Android devices nor the iPhone/iPod touch), and it even comes with a free extra 8GB SD card, for a total of 16GB. And now, to rant. Battery life isn’t what is should be - the phone is awesome, I want to use it, and it can barely get through the day - especially if I’m doing heavy stuff like Waze (GPS + Data + screen is always on + voice), but even if I’m just surfing casually. The unlock button is located inconveniently on the bottom part of the right side, just above the camera button. The home button is located between the Back and Send buttons, meaning it’s very easy to hit by accident; it’s not even labeled. The CPU isn’t always fast enough to keep everything completely smooth, and while this is generally acceptable, it gets rather irksome in odd places: If you turn on screen auto-rotation (which uses more battery power), rotation takes a while and might be accidental. However, there is no manual screen rotation option as far as I can tell. As a music player (relating to my previous post), the device works well enough - but I couldn’t, for the life of me, get Hebrew support in ID3 tags (no matter what the encoding is), and only a limited subset of ID3 tag versions is supported, and everything works much better with Ogg files. The flaws I’ve mentioned are relatively minor and nitpicky - for Waze, you can use the car charger (which comes with the phone, thankfully). The buttons are OK after some getting used to (and installing the excellent AnySoftKeyboard), and operation is generally smooth. However, there is a major issue I can’t wrap my head around - the shipped firmware is 1.5 cupcake, and there are absolutely zero updates available from Samsung. There is a semi-official leaked 1.6 update which, as I’ve heard, is quite buggy. An awesome guy called drakaz has been working on a Froyo (2.2) port for the Galaxy, which I really should check out, but Samsung’s behavior on this topic is inexcusable in my opinion.

I’ve had it for three years, so this would be a good time to review. My favorite thing about the Mini was the cost. When I bought it, it was far cheaper than comparable players, at ~400₪ for 8GB. For a player with good video support, it was a steal. Other pros it had include: Great screen. I used to watch TV shows on it quite a bit Great audio quality, especially in the lower range - very important for a bass guitarist Perfect OS compatibility - shows up as a Mass Storage device, just drag your files over. This is also how firmware upgrades are performed EBook reader, of sorts Quite small and very thin However, the player is full of quirks: Slow startup time. This is compounded by the fact that to turn it on, you have to press the “Play” button for about 3 seconds - too much less or too much more, and it won’t start up. This is even worse when unplugging it from USB - it would rebuild the library every time, even if you were just charging it. You can’t turn the player on when it’s connected to USB. When it’s off, connecting it to USB is for charging only - to access the filesystem, you have to disconnect it, turn it on, and connect it again. (…not that the player is functional when in it’s plugged in…) A few podcast niceties would be very easy to implement and extremely helpful. There’s no way to separate podcasts from the rest of the music, so you don’t get “This Week In Tech” when you put it on “All Music at random” mode. Also, the player doesn’t keep track of positions within audio streams, other than the last played one. There’s no way to delete a song from within the player. The interface is very inconsistent, with the video and audio sections having completely different key bindings. Long presses and short presses have very different meanings (but the length isn’t all that different), so you have to be very careful. Pressing various key during startup had interesting, non-obvious effects, such as rebuilding the music library or formatting the player without asking for confirmation. This isn’t in the official documentation, and even if it were - that’s a very bad misfeature. The newer version of the player, which I have, did away with the bottom “play” button, and moved it to the bottom of the 4-way D-pad, instead of the “Enter” key. The “Enter” key was replaced with a tap on the d-pad. Unfortunately, such a tap is very similar to a volume change drag, and even if it weren’t - is very easy to perform by accident. One more feature that I would have liked is one I’ve only seen in the iPod (which I despise for a variety of reasons) - the iPod keeps track of which songs you’ve played all the way through, and remembers that you “like” them - this information is later used when building playlists, and is integrated into iTunes playlists as well. Now, I might be going to a long course soon, one which will specifically mean plenty of bus time.

I have a military phone, which is far cheaper, so I’ve decided to keep it offline. However, being the sentimental guy that I am, I did want to save all of my contacts and SMS messages (in addition to the photos, which presented less of a problem). This proved to be a bit of a challenge without the screen working. Usually, when you connect the phone via USB, it asks if you want “PC Suite mode” or “Data Transfer mode”. The “Data Transfer” mode has the phone show up as a standard USB storage device, which allows for easy transfer of MP3 files, photos and videos to and from the phone, without any nokia-specific software.

Reading the implementation patch shows that there is a certain threshold for this - the position won’t be saved if you’re too close to the beginning or end of the video. So there, my show downloading stack now has every feature I’d want from Miro, without the downsides I’ve mentioned.

Regular show schedules are horrible, commercial breaks are annoying, and the ability to rewind is very important. I love Hot’s VOD service (and happily pay to watch the shows I enjoy), but my true favorite for getting my entertainment is everyone’s favorite not-a-dumptruck, the internet. In this post, I will describe how I do it. Everything I describe in this post can be done using miro. It’s a neat piece of software, which lacked polish in version 2.4 (2.5 is out now though), but there are a few things I don’t like about it: You have to be graphically logged in for it to run. Among other things, this means that if someone reboots your computer, there’s no way to get it to start automatically. (I’ll be very happy to know if I’m wrong about this) It doesn’t give you as much control as I’d like over torrents. Its BitTorrent client doesn’t perform as well as rtorrent. However, Miro does one thing which I haven’t figured out how to do myself yet: It keeps track of your position within watched shows. That is, stop watching a show -and next time playback will resume from the same place. The first thing you want to do is get a good RSS feed for your show. Unfortunately, Revision3’s shows (many of which are quite good), are direct HTTP download links, as per the advertiser’s request. For other shows, you can find torrent RSS feeds, which make much better use of everyone’s bandwidth. Also, downloading will be handled by our trusty rtorrent, which we can configure for bandwidth limiting. To download RSS feeds, I use flexget. It does its job well, but doesn’t support bandwidth limiting. It accepts a simple YAML configuration file, and has good logging. I run it as a cron job - its locking mechanism prevents multiple instances from running simultaneously. For non-torrents, I set the output directory to ~/torrents/inbox. For torrents, I set the output directory to ~/torrents/from_rss. For downloading torrents, I use rtorrent. It’s a curses-based client which performs very well. My .rtorrent.rc file looks like this: download_rate = 30 upload_rate = 2 directory = /home/ohad/torrents/in_progress on_finished = move_complete,\"execute=mv,-u,$d.get_base_path=,~/torrents/inbox/ ;d.set_directory=~/torrents/inbox/\" session = /home/ohad/torrents/.session schedule = watch_directory,5,5,load_start=/home/ohad/torrents/from_rss/*.torrent schedule = untied_directory,5,5,remove_untied= schedule = throttle_1,23:00:00,24:00:00,download_rate=0 schedule = throttle_2,05:00:00,24:00:00,download_rate=30 port_range = 6881-6889 encryption = allow_incoming,enable_retry,prefer_plaintext dht = auto peer_exchange = yes scgi_local = /tmp/rtorrent-scgi.socket Interesting things to note here are: Downloads live in one directory, but get moved to the inbox directory when they’re done. The session directory is important - this allows rtorrent to resume downloads if it’s shut down. The from_rss directory is watched for new torrent files. When the relevant downloads are stopped, remove_untied occurs and the torrent files are deleted. Throttling is fully customizable. The SCGI socket is useful for rtgui - we’ll get to that. I have a “watchdog”-style cron job which makes sure it’s running if the computer is up. This is not as elegant as starting it from an RC-script, but keeps the whole setup confined to the limits of my own user. Again, rtorrent has a lock-file which prevents multiple instances from running. #!/bin/bash # A simple script to make sure I am running rtorrent in a screen set -e SCGI_SOCKET=/tmp/rtorrent-scgi.socket SESSION_DIR=~/torrents/.session screen -d -m -fn -S rtorrent -s /bin/bash -t rtorrent -m nice rtorrent while [[ ! -S $SCGI_SOCKET ]]; do sleep 1; done if [[ -S $SCGI_SOCKET ]]; then chgrp www-data $SCGI_SOCKET chmod g+rwx $SCGI_SOCKET fi RTGUI provides a nice web-based interface.

The logical way to do this, in my opinion, is to have two separate files in /usr/share/zoneinfo, say IsraelIST and IsraelIDT, and copy (or link) the relevant one as /etc/localtime. The trick is creating the IsraelIDT file. My first guess was the following zic source-file: # Zone NAME GMTOFF RULES/SAVE FORMAT [UNTIL] Zone IsraelIDT 2:00 01:00 IDT Now, this almost works. The problem is that both is_dst is set and timezone = -10800 (3 hours - should be 2, as it should represent local standard time), so some software double-compensates here for a grand total of GMT+4:00. After some research (walking through __tzfile_read gave the biggest hint), it turns out that timezone is set according to the minimal local time type which is transitioned into. So I came up with this file: # Rule NAME FROM TO TYPE IN ON AT SAVE LETTER/S Rule ZionIDT min 1939 - Jan 1 00:00 1:00 D Rule ZionIDT 1939 only - Jan 1 00:00 0:00 S Rule ZionIDT 1940 max - Jan 1 00:00 1:00 D # Zone NAME GMTOFF RULES/SAVE FORMAT [UNTIL] Zone IsraelIDT 2:00 ZionIDT I%sT Sounds about right, nay? Even my handy little pyzdump confirms that it looks about how I want it to: $ ./pyzdump.py /usr/share/zoneinfo/IsraelIDT Transitions: ['At Sat Dec 31 23:00:00 1938, switch to IST', 'At Sun Dec 31 22:00:00 1939, switch to IDT'] Types: [\u003ctztype dst=\"True\" idt:=\"\" utc+10800=\"\"\u003e, \u003ctztype dst=\"False\" ist:=\"\" utc+7200=\"\"\u003e] However, it still doesn’t work. A test program: int main() { tzset(); time_t t = time(NULL); printf(\"Timezone name is %s, timezone=%ld\\n\", __tzname[1], timezone); printf(\"The time is %s\", ctime(\u0026t)); printf(\"Timezone name is %s, timezone=%ld\\n\", __tzname[1], timezone); return 0; } And its results, as run at 14:42:17 UTC, which is 19:42:17 IDT: Timezone name is IDT, timezone=-7200 The time is Sat Apr 18 14:42:17 2009 Timezone name is UTC, timezone=0 Or, as I described it to a friend: Me: Hi computer, do you know what timezone are we in? Computer: Yeah, it’s Israel Daylight Savings time, GMT+2:00 for standard time. Me: OK, and what time is it? Computer: 14:42 Me: No, that’s 3 hours late. What timezone are we in? Computer: Umm… UTC? Me: You just said IDT. Computer: Nuh-uh. I’ll get to the bottom of this eventually :/ Addendum: It seems that the problem is even more complicated. For the following timezone file, C programs seem to work fine: # Rule NAME FROM TO TYPE IN ON AT SAVE LETTER/S Rule ZionIDT min 1939 - Jan 1 00:00 1:00 D Rule ZionIDT 1939 only - Jan 1 00:00 0:00 S Rule ZionIDT 1940 2030 - Jan 1 00:00 1:00 D Rule ZionIDT 2030 max - Jan 1 00:00 0:00 S # Zone NAME GMTOFF RULES/SAVE FORMAT [UNTIL] Zone IsraelIDT 2:00 ZionIDT I%sT However, Python programs still show timezone = -10800. Examining Python’s code, I found this: if( janzone \u003c julyzone ) { /* DST is reversed in the southern hemisphere */ PyModule_AddIntConstant(m, \"timezone\", julyzone); PyModule_AddIntConstant(m, \"altzone\", janzone); PyModule_AddIntConstant(m, \"daylight\", janzone != julyzone); PyModule_AddObject(m, \"tzname\", Py_BuildValue(\"(zz)\", julyname, janname)); } else { PyModule_AddIntConstant(m, \"timezone\", janzone); PyModule_AddIntConstant(m, \"altzone\", julyzone); PyModule_AddIntConstant(m, \"daylight\", janzone != julyzone); PyModule_AddObject(m, \"tzname\", Py_BuildValue(\"(zz)\", janname, julyname)); } And since June and July have the same timezone in our case, there’s a good chance that this is what’s going wrong. The moral of the story seems to be this - I should go with the first, simplest “always-DST” solution. Programs should ignore the timezone variable, as in our context it isn’t reliable. In general, all internal time handling should be done in UTC; when reading times from the outside world, if they are in local time - use mktime. If they are in a specified timezone, use timegm and compensate manually.

Here’s proof. Today I went to visit my grandparents, and it turned out their computer wouldn’t boot. BIOS would load up fine, and I could browse the menus fine - but once it tried to go on from there, it would simply blink what looked like half a cursor (that is, half of a _-style cursor). I figured it might be the HDD - so I took it home, and decided to connect it to my own box. Upon disconnecting my DVD drive, I destroyed the SATA cord - it had an annoying little metal tab which had to be pushed in before it would release, and it just wouldn’t give, and the connector just broke, exposing and bending the wires. Checking if the computer still boots, the BIOS took much longer to display hard drive status, and while Ubuntu would start booting, it would fail in the process and tell me that my root hard drive (by UUID) isn’t available. Looking at dmesg, the ata2 module was indeed reporting that the hard drive was too slow - but a few seconds later it would finally access the drive, and mount properly. This problem, however, disappeared once I connected my grandparents' drive! (Mounting it would fail, telling me that I either have a hardware error or need to connect it to a Windows machine, which I don’t have, and run some diagnostic commands). Sure enough, when the HDD is connected by itself, it gets quite flaky, but once I connect a second drive (back to the DVD, eventually), everything works properly. This probably has to do with the fact that both drives are connected on continuations of the same power cord - but I’ve never experienced such a problem, where you must connect devices to both connectors on the power cord.

My point has to do with cellphones. True, most cellphones today come with cameras, are able to play video, and are rather capable mobile gaming platforms (when compared to the Game Boy, that is). All this does, in fact, require a color screen. However, I believe that there is a market for cellphones which do not support these features, but do support neat things like 3G internet connectivity (GMail and RSS on the phone is a major Win, in my opinion), and have a comfortable SMS interface. These features actually suffer from having a color screen: Battery life (for the powerful backlight), viewing angle, and screen resolution take a hit. While it’s true that color LCDs have come a long way since the Game Gear, so have black \u0026 white display technologies (E-Paper, anyone?). Of course, my wish for a modern B\u0026W-screen cellphone will likely never come true. The simple reason is that they would be totally unmarketable. Even business-types like color screens nowadays.

There is a patch for gtkspell which gets it to use enchant, but I don’t know of a simple way to get it to work in my distribution of choice, Ubuntu. Now you need a neat little plugin from the Guifications plugin pack, called SwitchSpell. Unfortunately, it’s in version 2.3.0 of the pack, whereas the current Ubuntu version is 2.0.0. It’s not complicated to install this from source though: I’ve detailed the precise installation procedure below; the confusing thing is that if you forget to install libgtkspell-dev or libaspell-dev, SwitchSpell will not be built, but the configure script tells you that it will. sudo apt-get install build-essential gettext libgtkspell-dev libaspell-dev pidgin-dev wget http://downloads.guifications.org/plugins//Plugin%20Pack/purple-plugin_pack-2.3.0.tar.bz2 tar jxvf purple-plugin_pack-2.3.0.tar.bz2 cd purple-plugin_pack-2.3.0 ./configure --with-plugins=switchspell make sudo make install At this point, the Switch Spell plugin should show up in your Pidgin preferences. When you activate it, you should get a menu at the top of each conversation for choosing the dictionary in use. Enjoy!

Part of the reason is that the exercise contains a time-limited tournament, and the code needs to run very quickly. Another reason is, I guess, the fact that C++ serves as a sort of lowest common denominator in the course (which used, by the way, to be taught in LISP, along with the language). I never liked C++ language much. As a matter of fact, I prefer C. I’ve been going over some old code for a project, which needed to use DBus to talk to NetworkManager. Back then I wrote it using Python, embedded in C - it seemed easier at the time, due to lack of documentation. After hunting around, I figured out how to do most of the stuff I wanted in C, using DBus’s GLib API. In this process, the most helpful bit of documentation turned out to be GLib’s. GLib looks like a wonderful library to get big-program stuff done relatively nicely in C, without mucking about in C++. Exception handling (of sorts), object-oriented programming (of sorts) as well as garbage collection (of sorts) are implemented in a usable way, and extremely well-documented. At the end of the day, I was able to turn this Python gem: import dbus def _nm_device_interface(dev_object): \"\"\"Returns an interface to the device object dev_object\"\"\" return dbus.Interface(dev_object, NM_DEVICE_IFACE) def _nm_get_object(object_path): \"\"\"Returns an object with the given object path using the NM service\"\"\" return dbus.SystemBus().get_object(NM_SERVICE, object_path) def _nm(): return _nm_get_object(NM_OBJECT_PATH) def _nm_dbus_exception(e, guessed_exception): \"\"\"Checks if the DBus exception e is (exactly) of type guessed_exception\"\"\" try: return e.get_dbus_name().endswith(guessed_exception) except: # If it doesn't have a get_dbus_name, it probably isn't the DBus # exception we're looking for. return False def _nm_all_device_interfaces(): \"\"\"Return a list of interfaces to all devices NM sees\"\"\" try: return [ _nm_device_interface(_nm_get_object(devicename)) for devicename in _nm().getDevices() ] except dbus.DBusException, e: if _nm_dbus_exception(e, \"NoDevices\"): return [] # No devices means list of devices is empty else: raise …into this C gem: #define DBUS_SERVICE_NM \"org.freedesktop.NetworkManager\" #define DBUS_PATH_NM \"/org/freedesktop/NetworkManager\" #define DBUS_INTERFACE_NM \"org.freedesktop.NetworkManager\" #define NM_ERR_NODEVICES \"org.freedesktop.NetworkManager.NoDevices\" gboolean is_remote_dbus_exception(GError *error, char * exception_name) { g_assert(error); if (error-\u003edomain != DBUS_GERROR || error-\u003ecode != DBUS_GERROR_REMOTE_EXCEPTION) return FALSE; if (!exception_name) return TRUE; return strcmp(dbus_g_error_get_name(error), exception_name) == 0; } GPtrArray * get_nm_devices(DBusGConnection *connection, GError **err) { GError *tmp_error = NULL; DBusGProxy *proxy; GPtrArray *ptr_array; g_return_val_if_fail(connection != NULL, NULL); proxy = dbus_g_proxy_new_for_name( connection, DBUS_SERVICE_NM, DBUS_PATH_NM, DBUS_INTERFACE_NM); dbus_g_proxy_call(proxy, \"getDevices\", \u0026tmp_error, G_TYPE_INVALID, dbus_g_type_get_collection(\"GPtrArray\", DBUS_TYPE_G_PROXY), \u0026ptr_array, G_TYPE_INVALID); if (tmp_error != NULL) { if (is_remote_dbus_exception(tmp_error, NM_ERR_NODEVICES)) { g_error_free(tmp_error); return NULL; } else { g_propagate_error(err, tmp_error); return NULL; } } g_object_unref(proxy); return ptr_array; } The C code runs much faster, and I suspect is more maintainable then its original counterpart (which uses embedded python in C).

It’s very small, but has a nice screen and a respectable 2 megapixel camera.

Another nice feature is the built-in MP3 player - which is actually made relevant due to the micro-SD support and included 1GB SD card. The device has a standard USB connection (cable included, but it’s an ordinary Mini-to-A cable), and has a Mass Storage Device mode, so it works well with any OS. It can also automatically text-to-speech the name of the caller (or dial by voice recognition, which works remarkably well), which is handy when listening to MP3s.

(or shnekel, if you like) I have a serious problem with religion; It is my opinion that it is an overly powerful means of control. Whether it has evolved as such or not is hard to tell. But today it seems to pose a very serious threat to the world. Now, don’t get me wrong - control of this type is very important and useful. Specifically, it manifests itself in a basic moral system which, many believe, has served mankind well. You know, “thou shalt not murder”, stuff like that. Some may even say that it was a central factor in overcoming our primal urges, and development into the ever-so-slightly more sophisticated society we are today. However, there are other, more dangerous manifestations of this control. Specifically, it seems all-too-easy nowadays to get up and say “This-and-that god has spoken to me - we must kill those-and-them”. “God has spoken to me, we must, uh, enlighten these our-religious-character-rejecting other-religion-followers. There’s some oil in it for us, too”. “This land has been promised to us this-and-that years ago, we must kill all other-religion-dwellers”. Of course, the link here is politics. When used as a series of anecdotes, morals, stories, hell - even as a way of life - religious is mostly harmless. However, when a religious leader becomes a political figure, the temptation is simply too great, and religion becomes used as a tool of the agenda. It doesn’t take a whole staff of advisors and a big media budget to convince the public now - it only takes a proper connection with arbitrary dogma to do that. Throughout the years, the secular public has wished for separation of church and state.

Essentially, the package provides an API identical to Python’s threading, but uses processes and pipes (or other mechanisms on non-posix operating systems) instead. What the magazine does not cover is the fact that this can also benefit GUI applications; updating a progressbar in the application doesn’t need to slow down heavy computations being done in a separate thread.

Fortunately, it’s very simple to use - especially thanks to this guide. It later turned out to be much easier to do in C, as described in Faster Languages. Now, we couldn’t have the Python code throwing exceptions outwards, so we had each function return, along with its actual return value (if any), a numeric code identifying the error. Unfortunately, this made the code get really big, really fast - especially once DBus exceptions are thrown into the mix.

And as a technology enthusiast, there are many new and cool things to see online. For example, there’s the new Schools site, part of the Vaya project which helps Israeli schools use Linux; this site uses the up-and-coming Lahak CMS, built on the Django framework, and looks very promising to the eyes of the bidi-lingual webmaster. However, some things just plain suck. One of them is myspace; today, in an attempt to make it more legible, I found that My Band’s Page implements all of its styling changes by a “style” tag hidden within the “Members” text block. Myspace doesn’t filter this out - nor does it provide any other means of changing the styling. This, combined with myspace’s horrid administration interface, makes editing incredible unwieldy. I’m considering opening another Wordpress site for the band here on this server… And on that topic - Wordpress 2.2 is out. Shinier. Faster. Built-in support for sidebar modules. And K2 broke :(. I love K2… Even though now that sidebars are implemented, the only thing I really need is a very simple template that allows me an ordinary, rectangular logo. Update: I didn’t even notice, but the excellent K2 guys released a fix. However, it seems that when you copy the plugin they created directly, it inadvertantly adds a space to the end of the file - and PHP proceeds to barf.

The strike has begun immediately after passover, and is certainly beginning to take its toll. For one thing, I have no homework deadlines - a rare situation indeed for the Technion student. Furthermore, contemplations are rising about whether or not this coming summer semester will be held, as the current semester will most likely leak into it. This is of special interest to me, as I’m behind on my degree, which is problematic because of my military scholarship. This is shaping up to be the second time in which, while I’ve been authorized by the military to take a summer semester for completion, I am not able to. However, one cannot trivially dismiss this strike; in a country which is known worldwide mostly for its technological exports and frequent bloodbaths, one shouldn’t take the matter of tuition lightly. The vacation was not, however, boring - I got to spend a lot of time with my lovely girlfriend, a chance to see friends I have not seen in a long time, and a lot of posts racked up in various forums. The vacation actually expanded far enough to contain independence day, so I managed to experience the closest thing to a hangover I’d ever had (But that was some great scotch). Actually, independence day could have been truly superb; the whole thing got me thinking about what the perfect night out would be: It’s obviously best with my girlfriend. It would probably start with a rock show of sorts, continue with food and beer, and end in my girlfriend’s bed. Better yet - if I’m in the show. Better still - if there’s no reason to get up early the following day. Another item of interest is that I’ve joined a band. Hopefully I’ll be able to keep up the 3-hours-on-Saturday rehearsals. It’s a “Trash Metal” band which has evidently had really bad experience with bass players. Unfortunately, we seem to have a myspace page. It looks… myspaceish. However, I really think the group has potential, as well as excellent influences. Furthermore, I’m an attention whore :D. Hopefully I’ll be able to help influence the band into more of a heavy-metal direction by harassing them with melodic basslines. Very little geek news this time, other than the fact that Feisty Fawn is out. My verdict - get it. It’s awesome. Period. Suspend works much better, NetworkManager is now installed by default, a lot of things have really been polished, and - can you believe it - Sudoku :)! If you already run Ubuntu, I’d advise against using the update manager - it works, but it takes a long time, and cannot run unattended. Also, a word of caution to server admins though - sqlite3 is the new default, so if you have sqlite2 databases you’ll need to convert them (use the sqlite and sqlite3 binaries to do this) - otherwise you’ll get “file is not a database, or is encrypted” errors.

While a few good points were made, the major one - in my opinion - was not. DRM, in a practical sense, is deeply flawed: The idea is to give you your media - say, a WMA piece of music - and a program to play it with - say, Windows Media Player - but encrypt the media. Now, naturally, Media Player will need the decryption key for the media, and the idea is that Media Player will verify that you are allowed to listen to the song, and only then decrypt it - as it is played. However, something is clearly wrong here - both the encrypted media and the decryption key are sitting locally on your computer. It’s like giving you a locked box, as well as a butler (which will live in your house, where you presumably have a shotgun) with the key, and telling the butler not to open the box for anyone unauthorized. That is, you can open the Windows Media Player executable with your favorite hex editor, and dig away for the key. This is, of course, very complicated to do - but there are advanced ways of finding these keys, and once they’re found - they’re out. That’s why we keep hearing about WMA and iTunes’ equivalent format being cracked every once in a while, when they change it. No matter how sophisticated the DRM, you still get both the locked box and the key. They might build bigger butlers, but we can build deadlier shotguns. (Sorry for the violent analogy, but DRM kinda does that to me ;)) So, what can the *AA/Microsoft/Apple/DRM scapegoats inc. do about this? Well, they could supposedly have Windows recognize that you are trying to view the Windows Media Player executable, and stop you (I’d be surprised if they haven’t done this yet). However, currently you can still, for example, run Linux on the computer, and use that to view the executable. And if, by some crazy coincidence, all variants of Linux stop you from viewing the executable - you can pick your favorite, change the source code so it doesn’t, and use that. To stop you from running whatever unprotected operating system you want, changes to the hardware must be made. This is exactly what worries me about Vista. For the first time, we are seeing major effects like HDMI/HDCP, where the operating system interacts with the hardware directly to figure out exactly what the user is or isn’t allowed to do. Also, Vista boasts the “Trustworthy Computing” project, which is all too reminiscent of “Trusted Computing” - a project in which, through integrating protection from the bottom of the hardware (with a TPM, Trusted Platform Module chip) to the top of the software, the computer verifies that it is only running authorized operating systems, which run only authorized programs. Now, the media companies would love this. Say HD-DVD’s been completely cracked, and an alternative, open-source, unprotected player has been released. If your system is TPM-protected, it simply won’t allow this software to run. Your own compiled applications can be forbidden from running as well, seeing as their source code just might be the HD-DVD cracking code. Unauthorized operating systems would, naturally, not be allowed to run. Now, I’m not explicitly blaming Microsoft for this. Fact of the matter is, the protection they’ve built into Vista, although probably (for the reasons I’ve mentioned) insufficient, was required by the media companies in order for HD-DVD support to be (legally/technically) possible in Vista. Would Microsoft go so far as to enable the horror scenario I’ve pictured above? Probably not. But I do believe we all need to be aware of the risks, just to be on the safe side.

Die-hard Microsoft fans were sure Vista would be the final nail in the Open Source coffin, die-hard Linux fans were sure that the release would be Microsoft’s demise. Myself - I’m sitting and enjoying the show. It’s always very interesting to show Beryl to non-Linux users. They are almost always highly impressed, and are often completely in shock that Linux is a graphical system - many people still believe Linux is command-line only. But the funniest thing is that they always seem to care more about useless, spinning, transparent desktop cubes than, say, security. This holds for Vista’s flashy new graphics, as well - mainstream media seems to be focusing on Vista’s GUI a lot more than they are about its controversial new security features. Very interesting, keeping in mind that Windows has never been “not pretty enough” in consumer’s eyes, but rather too unstable or virus-prone. Controversial security? Yup. And I’m not even talking about the actually controversy-worth topics, like DRM… I’m talking about the system asking if you’re sure you want to set the clock. I’ve heard more noise about this than the fact that all of Vista’s new features pale in comparison to 7-year-old OS X which, incidentally, also “asks if you’re sure” that you want to set the clock. Nobody complains about that however. Why? In my opinion - it’s the password prompt. Just as people complained about Windows XP’s “Fisher-Price” theme, they’re now complaining about being treated like little kids. “Are you sure you want to set your clock?” - how condescending of the operating system. The reason it works well in Linux and OS X is that the system phrases the exact same question completely differently - “You are attempting to run “system-config-date” which requires administrative privileges”. Cryptic, right? I think they changed that for Ubuntu, too (I’m writing this off a Fedora box). But most users won’t have a hard time understanding that this, coupled with the password entry box, means that the system wants to make sure you are indeed someone allowed to set the clock. Hell, I believe that most people won’t have a problem making the logical leap from there to “hmm, perhaps setting the clock (im)properly can really mess up my system”. Either way, it’s much more pleasing than Vista’s seemingly endless, senseless sequences of “Are you sure?” dialog boxes. A password prompt like this tells the user - “You’re opening the hood here, watch your step”, the idea being that the user takes a hint and, realizing he has arrived at a password-protected part of his system, will indeed watch his proverbial step. But nobody is going to ditch windows over a couple of dialog boxes. There are much more interesting reasons to do that - I’ve heard of much instability, inavailability of drivers, confusions in the user interface… all of the things that Microsoft worked very hard to get rid of when XP was released, making Vista look like a step back. But most of all - it’s the timing. Vista’s 2007 release has given the world time to hear about shiny new Linux distributions, macs that run all of their old software, indexing services at least as powerful as Vista’s (now that WinFS has gone down the drain), more advanced graphical “shinyness” which works on older systems, and the horrors of DRM (thanks for that one, Sony). With nothing really new to give them, a high price tag (because it often includes a new computer), and several years of not being in the habit of buying a new OS, people have very little motivation to upgrade to Vista. But I don’t think that Microsoft and Windows are going anywhere, anytime soon. I do think Vista’s lost the battle - but to XP. Vista’s launch made people realize how successful XP was as an operating system, and the sheer momentum will keep people there. If Microsoft locks people out of technologies like DirectX 10 by making them Vista-only, this will keep people leaking away to OS X and Li","date":"2007-02-04","objectID":"/posts/on-vista/:0:0","tags":["software"],"title":"On Vista","uri":"/posts/on-vista/"},{"categories":null,"content":"This is absolutely antique (2000), but it’s good to hear an artist with a clue. http://archive.salon.com/tech/feature/2000/06/14/love/print.html ","date":"2007-02-02","objectID":"/posts/courtney-love-on-piracy/:0:0","tags":["life"],"title":"Courtney Love on Piracy","uri":"/posts/courtney-love-on-piracy/"},{"categories":null,"content":"If you’re like me, and don’t use Gnome or KDE, then you probably use the pmount or pmount-hal applications to mount removable media.
