Despite having a critical midterm Sunday, as well as being sick, I could not,
and should not have, give up on the [NaNuchKa](http://myspace.com/nanuchka)
show. Some of the best music I've ever heard, no doubt, and with the
unexpectedly intimate setting, I had the opportunity to get to know the truly
incredible Yula after the show. They're playing in Tel-Aviv today, at the
Koltura, where I was supposed to... Fantastic music, at any rate. Keep your
ears open!
