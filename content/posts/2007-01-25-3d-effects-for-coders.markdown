title: 3D effects for coders?
---

My new work desktop has a GeForce 4 MX, so I naturally installed Beryl on it.
The graphics card has relatively little RAM, so it finds handling my 1280x1024
resolution difficult when additional texture memory is needed - so using
something like Firefox really slows it down when Beryl is activated, making me
keep it off most of the time. However, for coding, I'm finding that Beryl is
very useful - it actually helps me that the code windows are transparent, so
that I can see what's underneath them, and the "Expose" effect still leaves
text legible, which is great for reading off a lot of terminals at once. So is
Beryl... a programmer's tool?
