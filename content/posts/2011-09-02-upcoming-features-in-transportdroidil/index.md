title: Upcoming features in TransportDroidIL
---

<!-- markdownlint-disable MD013 -->

Hello everyone, TransportDroidIL 1.0 will be released this month. It has quite a few new features:

1. Separate "Source", "Destination" and "Time" fields. This is much better for
   auto-completion as well.
2. Automatic location-based detection of "Source". Hopefully you'll find the
   interface for this unobtrusive.
3. Quick reversal of "Source" and "Destination", for your return trip.
4. A new settings screen, with:
   - Provider selection (currently Egged or MOT)
   - A small attempt at right-to-left fixes for non-supporting devices.
   - A "clear history" button

Everyone loves screenshots:
