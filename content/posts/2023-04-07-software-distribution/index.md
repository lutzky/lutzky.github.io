## QBasic

In the early 90s, when I was about 8 years old, someone showed me that my
computer came with a piece of software called [QBasic][qbasic] - it came with
the MS-DOS operating system.  Although nobody in my family knew how to use it,
and this was long before I had access to the internet, it came with an
impressive set of examples as well as an interactive reference manual that I
recall as being very thorough. Having messed around with it and made a few
animations and utilities, I thought it would be cool to give copies to my
classmates to play around with; y'know, like a professional software developer would.

This presented an interesting problem. The software, as I wrote it, was a
collection of source code files - just text files with a `.BAS` extension. For
anyone to run those programs, they'd have to open QBasic themselves, use the
"Fileâ†’Open" menu command, select my file, then use the "Run" menu to actually
run the program. And presumably figure out how to exit QBasic when they're done.
Now, for 90s 8-year-olds, typing out a command or two to open a game from DOS
was reasonable, and indeed, friends did figure this out, but it felt *super
janky*.

What I actually wanted to do was provide a self-contained program, one where you
simply enter its name and it starts up, like any other DOS program (or game!)
I'd seen. Ideally, it would have the coveted `.EXE` extension, as the term
"`EXE` file" seemed pretty much synonymous with "program". I'm not sure if I
figured it out at the time, but I could've probably included a `.BAT` (MS-DOS
Batch) file with the contents `QBASIC /RUN LUTZKY1.BAS`, maybe with some `@echo
off` or whatever was the right syntax for reducing janky output... but it felt
"off".

I had heard rumor of the "professional, expensive" bit of software I needed - a
*compiler*, which would perform the right magic to me a shiny, self-contained
`LUTZKY1.EXE`. But this sounded like an expensive thing to even ask my parents
for, never mind the fact I had no idea where one *buys software* (other than
games).

In 2023, I found out that this software was called [QuickBASIC][quickbasic]...
not confusing at all, surely the Q in QBasic didn't stand for "Quick" and they
weren't both abbreviated "QB".

I vaguely remember messing around blindly with files on my computer, trying to
generate an EXE file complete with an icon. (Add note about PIF files)
