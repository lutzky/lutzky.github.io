title: Really liking the whole Python thing
---

I've converted my _Antigibberish script_[^footnote]
(converts "broken hebrew" into proper hebrew, useful for sent-offline ICQ
messages) to Python... it's quite a nice language, and the interpreter is FAST!
I'm really torn between it and Ruby :(

[^footnote]: Used to have a copy of `antigibberish.py`, but it's been lost in
    the mists of time. It used to do the equivalent of this:

    `iconv -f utf-8 -t iso8859-1 | iconv -f iso8859-8 -t utf-8`
