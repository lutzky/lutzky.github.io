This Saturday we're going to record our material, and hopefully a cover we've
been working on - Venom's excellent "School Daze". We took some photos
yesterday, visible here:

We have a show at the Koltura Club on July 12th.[^mists2]

[^mists]: Link modified to accomodate mists of time.
[^mists2]: Poster lost in the mists of time, show ended up being cancelled at the last moment.
