On an online board, friends posted a photo from a party a while back, as I'm chewing some extra-sour chewing gum:

I find this suitable for use in macro form. For example, in the Computer
Security course, we're going to compromise a windows-based server using a
buffer overflow vulnerability. Unfortunately, this means we're going to have to
use (as per the course's demands) Visual Studio 2003. My response:
