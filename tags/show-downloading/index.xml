It&amp;rsquo;s changed a bit since - I now use Transmission rather than rtorrent, as it has the excellent transmission-daemon package which has it acting exactly the way I like (without using screen). Also, it now E-mails me when a torrent is done downloading. So while this may be how TV works for you:
Notice that a new episode is out Torrent it Wait for the download to finish Watch it &amp;hellip;this is how TV works for me now:</description></item><item><title>Loving the new Totem</title><link>https://lutzky.net/2009/10/10/loving-the-new-totem/</link><pubDate>Sat, 10 Oct 2009 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://lutzky.net/2009/10/10/loving-the-new-totem/</guid><description>Totem is Gnome&amp;rsquo;s built-in media player, and it really annoyed me in previous versions, and had me switching to VLC.

Regular show schedules are horrible, commercial breaks are annoying, and the ability to rewind is very important. I love Hot&amp;rsquo;s VOD service (and happily pay to watch the shows I enjoy), but my true favorite for getting my entertainment is everyone&amp;rsquo;s favorite not-a-dumptruck, the internet. In this post, I will describe how I do it.
Everything I describe in this post can be done using miro.</description></item><item><title>Alright, American Dad!</title><link>https://lutzky.net/2007/01/23/alright-american-dad/</link><pubDate>Tue, 23 Jan 2007 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://lutzky.net/2007/01/23/alright-american-dad/</guid><description>Just finished downloading an episode of AmericanÂ Dad off Bittorrent.
