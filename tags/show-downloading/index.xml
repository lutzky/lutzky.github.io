It&amp;rsquo;s
changed a bit since - I now use &lt;a href="http://transmission-bt.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">Transmission&lt;/a>
rather than rtorrent, as it has the excellent &lt;code>transmission-daemon&lt;/code> package
which has it acting exactly the way I like (without using &lt;code>screen&lt;/code>). Also, it
now E-mails me when a torrent is done downloading. So while this may be how TV
works for you:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Notice that a new episode is out&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Torrent it&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Wait for the download to finish&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Watch it&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>&amp;hellip;this is how TV works for me now:&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Loving the new Totem</title><link>https://lutzky.net/posts/loving-the-new-totem/</link><pubDate>Sat, 10 Oct 2009 13:04:00 +0000</pubDate><author>lutzky@gmail.com (Ohad Lutzky)</author><guid>https://lutzky.net/posts/loving-the-new-totem/</guid><description>&lt;p>Totem is Gnome&amp;rsquo;s built-in media player, and it really annoyed me in previous
versions, and had me switching to VLC. However, the version included in the
Ubuntu 9.10 release candidate has two features which are very important, in my
opinion. The first feature is smooth graphical integration with compositing
managers (such as compiz). In previous versions, as well as VLC, once you
fullscreen the window, moving the mouse (which causes the cursor and the
partial interface to appear) causes a very annoying flicker. This has been
fixed (at least on my box, using an NVidia card).&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>My show downloading stack</title><link>https://lutzky.net/posts/my-show-downloading-stack/</link><pubDate>Sat, 05 Sep 2009 13:42:00 +0000</pubDate><author>lutzky@gmail.com (Ohad Lutzky)</author><guid>https://lutzky.net/posts/my-show-downloading-stack/</guid><description>&lt;p>I love watching TV, and hate it. Regular show schedules are horrible,
commercial breaks are annoying, and the ability to rewind is very important. I
love Hot&amp;rsquo;s VOD service (and happily pay to watch the shows I enjoy), but my
true favorite for getting my entertainment is everyone&amp;rsquo;s favorite
not-a-dumptruck, the internet. In this post, I will describe how I do it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Everything I describe in this post can be done using
&lt;a href="http://getmiro.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">miro&lt;/a>. It&amp;rsquo;s a neat piece of software, which lacked polish
in version 2.4 (2.5 is out now though), but there are a few things I don&amp;rsquo;t like
about it:&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Alright, American Dad!</title><link>https://lutzky.net/posts/alright-american-dad/</link><pubDate>Tue, 23 Jan 2007 22:13:00 +0000</pubDate><author>lutzky@gmail.com (Ohad Lutzky)</author><guid>https://lutzky.net/posts/alright-american-dad/</guid><description>&lt;p>Just finished downloading an episode of AmericanÂ Dad off Bittorrent. TV has
ancient episodes of Family Guy. Took about an hour though&amp;hellip; I tells ya, I&amp;rsquo;d
pay for this kind of service if it were faster&amp;hellip; ;)&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
