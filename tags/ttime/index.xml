bit lately. Lots of cool stuff went in:</p>
<ul>
<li>Boaz Goldstein&rsquo;s TCal, a Cairo-based schedule renderer (could you believe the
old version used MozEmbed?)</li>
<li>Sports courses are now correctly parsed</li>
<li>Ability to select specific lectures and groups for the automated scheduler</li>
<li>A manual scheduler - given an existing schedule, you can ask to show all
alternatives at once, and hand-pick them. Some people
(<a href="http://iiafw.com">Tom</a>, for example) prefer this.</li>
<li>Just for kicks - interoperability with <a href="http://udonkey.com">Grandpa</a>&rsquo;s XML
format</li>
</ul>
<p>I&rsquo;ve also cleaned up the packaging quite a bit - it can now be installed using
<code>setup.rb</code>, or the updated Debian package. I think it may soon be time to tag a
release :)</p>

As you can see, it&amp;rsquo;s TTime! With a shiny new Cairo interface. We&amp;rsquo;re back to the Ruby version, too - as we have another coder on board, which is using his compilation skills in order to write a new REPY parser.
You can also see it&amp;rsquo;s only found one schedule. This is thanks to the group selection constraint which was finally coded.</description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>So, I see I forgot to post my schedule for this semester&hellip;</p>
