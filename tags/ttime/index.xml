I&amp;rsquo;ve added issue tracking for ttime using the fantastic ditz. I&amp;rsquo;ve also added ttime&amp;rsquo;s rdoc documentation. (Note: Version 0.8.5 is out)</description></item><item><title>Been working on TTime</title><link>https://lutzky.net/2008/07/11/been-working-on-ttime/</link><pubDate>Fri, 11 Jul 2008 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://lutzky.net/2008/07/11/been-working-on-ttime/</guid><description>I&amp;rsquo;ve found myself working on TTime, the Technion Timetable Scheduler, quite a bit lately. Lots of cool stuff went in:
Boaz Goldstein&amp;rsquo;s TCal, a Cairo-based schedule renderer (could you believe the old version used MozEmbed?) Sports courses are now correctly parsed Ability to select specific lectures and groups for the automated scheduler A manual scheduler - given an existing schedule, you can ask to show all alternatives at once, and hand-pick them.</description></item><item><title>Scheduling</title><link>https://lutzky.net/2008/06/02/scheduling/</link><pubDate>Mon, 02 Jun 2008 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://lutzky.net/2008/06/02/scheduling/</guid><description>So, I see I forgot to post my schedule for this semester&amp;hellip;

As you can see, it&amp;rsquo;s TTime! With a shiny new Cairo interface. We&amp;rsquo;re back to the Ruby version, too - as we have another coder on board, which is using his compilation skills in order to write a new REPY parser.
You can also see it&amp;rsquo;s only found one schedule.</description></item></channel></rss>
