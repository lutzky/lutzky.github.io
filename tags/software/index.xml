However, it&amp;rsquo;s code has largely been integrated into TransportDroidIL. An old version of the Python code has been pasted at the end of this post.
Here&amp;rsquo;s a little something I&amp;rsquo;ve been messing with: A simple fetcher script for the Egged (Israeli bus company) site. I&amp;rsquo;ve made a deskbar applet which uses it, which was fun to do :) (I&amp;rsquo;m looking for other cool ideas to implement as deskbar applets)</description></item><item><title>Two reasons Apple suck</title><link>https://lutzky.net/2007/09/16/two-reasons-apple-suck/</link><pubDate>Sun, 16 Sep 2007 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://lutzky.net/2007/09/16/two-reasons-apple-suck/</guid><description>First of all, new iPods won&amp;rsquo;t work on Linux. Now, while it&amp;rsquo;s very obvious that the idea is to block competition against other music vendors, that makes it even less legitimate. Good thing we&amp;rsquo;re starting to see some very nice cheap players out there - I&amp;rsquo;ve been rather impressed with the Meizu M6 MiniPlayer.
Secondly, they didn&amp;rsquo;t think of this: Indexed search within the &amp;ldquo;Open&amp;rdquo; dialog. It&amp;rsquo;s in Ubuntu Gutsy, and really makes desktop search (implemented with Tracker in gutsy) worthwhile.</description></item><item><title>Myspace sucks</title><link>https://lutzky.net/2007/05/17/myspace-sucks/</link><pubDate>Thu, 17 May 2007 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://lutzky.net/2007/05/17/myspace-sucks/</guid><description>Life is good, for the most part. And as a technology enthusiast, there are many new and cool things to see online. For example, there&amp;rsquo;s the new Schools site, part of the Vaya project which helps Israeli schools use Linux; this site uses the up-and-coming Lahak CMS, built on the Django framework, and looks very promising to the eyes of the bidi-lingual webmaster.
However, some things just plain suck. One of them is myspace; today, in an attempt to make it more legible, I found that My Band&amp;rsquo;s Page implements all of its styling changes by a &amp;ldquo;style&amp;rdquo; tag hidden within the &amp;ldquo;Members&amp;rdquo; text block.</description></item><item><title>Beautiful ideas</title><link>https://lutzky.net/2007/02/08/beautiful-ideas/</link><pubDate>Thu, 08 Feb 2007 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://lutzky.net/2007/02/08/beautiful-ideas/</guid><description>This man has some beautiful design ideas for the Linux desktop.</description></item><item><title>Why Vista worries me</title><link>https://lutzky.net/2007/02/07/why-vista-worries-me/</link><pubDate>Wed, 07 Feb 2007 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://lutzky.net/2007/02/07/why-vista-worries-me/</guid><description>I&amp;rsquo;ve heard the latest Security Now, regarding the debate between Dave Marsh and Peter Guttman on DRM in Windows Vista. While a few good points were made, the major one - in my opinion - was not.
DRM, in a practical sense, is deeply flawed: The idea is to give you your media - say, a WMA piece of music - and a program to play it with - say, Windows Media Player - but encrypt the media.</description></item><item><title>On Vista</title><link>https://lutzky.net/2007/02/04/on-vista/</link><pubDate>Sun, 04 Feb 2007 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://lutzky.net/2007/02/04/on-vista/</guid><description>Everyone knew this was going to be an interesting one to watch. Die-hard Microsoft fans were sure Vista would be the final nail in the Open Source coffin, die-hard Linux fans were sure that the release would be Microsoft&amp;rsquo;s demise. Myself - I&amp;rsquo;m sitting and enjoying the show.
It&amp;rsquo;s always very interesting to show Beryl to non-Linux users. They are almost always highly impressed, and are often completely in shock that Linux is a graphical system - many people still believe Linux is command-line only.</description></item><item><title>Software Perfection - Lost in the details</title><link>https://lutzky.net/2007/01/25/software-perfection-lost-in-the-details/</link><pubDate>Thu, 25 Jan 2007 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://lutzky.net/2007/01/25/software-perfection-lost-in-the-details/</guid><description>Sometimes imperfections in Software drive me nuts. It&amp;rsquo;s what drove me away from Windows. It&amp;rsquo;s what keeps me switching back and forth between desktop environments. It&amp;rsquo;s what has me wasting a lot of time getting the software to do what I want, instead of getting anything done. I even have two particularily good examples.
Firefox and Opera are my two favorite browsers. Opera is actually not as good, in my taste, as Firefox.</description></item></channel></rss>
