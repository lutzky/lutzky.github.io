Source control is super important. Mistakes will be made, other coders will want to join in, and experimental features will want to be in their own branches. Git is awesome; it does source control right, gives me powerful tools, and isn&amp;rsquo;t a hassle to set up - even for a small project like this.</description></item><item><title>Upcoming features in TransportDroidIL</title><link>https://lutzky.net/2011/09/02/upcoming-features-in-transportdroidil/</link><pubDate>Fri, 02 Sep 2011 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://lutzky.net/2011/09/02/upcoming-features-in-transportdroidil/</guid><description>Hello everyone, TransportDroidIL 1.0 will be released this month. It has quite a few new features:
Separate &amp;ldquo;Source&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;Destination&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Time&amp;rdquo; fields. This is much better for auto-completion as well. Automatic location-based detection of &amp;ldquo;Source&amp;rdquo;. Hopefully you&amp;rsquo;ll find the interface for this unobtrusive. Quick reversal of &amp;ldquo;Source&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Destination&amp;rdquo;, for your return trip. A new settings screen, with: Provider selection (currently Egged or MOT) A small attempt at right-to-left fixes for non-supporting devices.</description></item><item><title>Android</title><link>https://lutzky.net/2010/09/04/android/</link><pubDate>Sat, 04 Sep 2010 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://lutzky.net/2010/09/04/android/</guid><description>I&amp;rsquo;ve finally gotten the chance to get one of those newfangled Android phones.
I&amp;rsquo;ve recently &amp;ldquo;bought&amp;rdquo; a Samsung Galaxy Android phone (the older i7500, not the newer i9000 &amp;ldquo;S&amp;rdquo;) model. It&amp;rsquo;s a seriously serious upgrade from my old Nokia 6120 Classic, and as I broke the 6120&amp;rsquo;s screen and reverted back to my trusty old Nokia 6070 (which I couldn&amp;rsquo;t even get to run the GMail app), I was quite a happy camper switching to a modern phone.</description></item><item><title>Setting up Hebrew Android fonts on your AVD emulator</title><link>https://lutzky.net/2010/09/04/setting-up-hebrew-android-fonts-on-your-avd-emulator/</link><pubDate>Sat, 04 Sep 2010 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://lutzky.net/2010/09/04/setting-up-hebrew-android-fonts-on-your-avd-emulator/</guid><description>There are several good guides for installing Gilad Ben-Yossef&amp;rsquo;s excellent Hebdroid fonts on physical Android devices, but those don&amp;rsquo;t really work with the Android SDK&amp;rsquo;s emulator - changes to the system directory aren&amp;rsquo;t persistent. Here&amp;rsquo;s how to get around that:
First, a few downloads. You&amp;rsquo;ll need:
The android emulator (presumably you already have this, if not, you can get it at developer.android.com) The hebdroid fonts unyaffs, which will extract the system.</description></item><item><title>Transport Droid IL</title><link>https://lutzky.net/2010/09/04/transport-droid-il/</link><pubDate>Sat, 04 Sep 2010 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://lutzky.net/2010/09/04/transport-droid-il/</guid><description>After a couple of days' messing with it, I&amp;rsquo;m releasing it: Transport Droid IL! It&amp;rsquo;s a handy little app for querying Egged&amp;rsquo;s site, as well as the new Ministry of Transportation site, on transportation information. This is pretty beta, but seems to work well enough.
