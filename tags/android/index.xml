utility to query Israeli public transportation sites more easily using an
Android phone.</p>
<p>Source control is super important. Mistakes will be made, other coders will
want to join in, and experimental features will want to be in their own
branches. <a href="http://git-scm.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">Git</a> is awesome; it does source control
<em>right</em>, gives me powerful tools, and isn&rsquo;t a hassle to set up - even for a
small project like this. <a href="http://github.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">Github</a> is also awesome; it makes
collaboration with other coders - even just one, in my case - easy, organized,
and fun.</p>
<p>One of my favorite git features is <em>revert</em>. It allows you to automatically
inverse a previous change. Here&rsquo;s an example from TransportDroidIL:
<a href="https://github.com/lutzky/TransportDroidIL/commit/0e194de5b8f24f85a3b4931963a06743525dacf8" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">0e194de</a>.
This commit reverts a previous &ldquo;cleanup&rdquo; commit in the autocompletion code -
allegedly, I was keeping two copies of the autocompletion option list for no
reason: One as a <code>LinkedList&lt;string&gt;</code>, and one internal to the
AutoCompleteTextView which I can access via an <code>ArrayAdapter&lt;string&gt;</code>. Turns out
that my <code>LinkedList&lt;string&gt;</code> copy is necessary, because the <code>ArrayAdapter&lt;string&gt;</code>
always behaves as though it&rsquo;s empty, so it cannot truly be read from. Despite
having performed a few commits since that bad &ldquo;fix&rdquo;, git was very helpful in
letting me revert that particular change, showing me the conflicts this
operation causes, and allowing me to fix them. The lesson is an important one:
Make small, manageable commits. Git is optimized for this, as commits are local
(no need to contact the server until a <em>push</em>).</p>
<p>Developing for Android makes a lot of sense when using Eclipse. I&rsquo;m a VIM
junkie, and generally dislike IDEs. Eclipse is slow and heavy - but it gets the
job done, and it does it very well. It&rsquo;s a bit weird that a plugin is required
to manage color schemes - but it exists. It&rsquo;s <strong>very</strong> weird (and quite
annoying) that it doesn&rsquo;t remove end-of-line white-space, and doesn&rsquo;t have an
option to do this. This makes git complain. There <em>is</em> an option to add
&ldquo;clean-up&rdquo; settings which are activated on every save, but this is far too
cumbersome and might change code I didn&rsquo;t intend to change (which becomes
confusing in the revision log). Still, the excellent debugging, JUnit and
logcat support are worth it.</p>
<p>Logcat is another awesome feature of Android. Every logged line has both a
&ldquo;Tag&rdquo; (usually defined per-class) and a severity. Logs can be filtered with a
different severity for each tag, and still - one can use the same logcat to
show messages from anything running on the Android device at the moment. It&rsquo;s
basically Syslog done better.</p>
<p>One last point is about Hebrew. This has been a problem with Android for quite
a while; for example, in a stock Android 2.3.3, numbers embedded in Hebrew
string appear backwards. Fixes exist, and are implemented in most Israeli ROMs,
especially the ones distributed by phone carriers - but they&rsquo;re different, and
sometimes don&rsquo;t work for all applications. This causes numbers to appear
backwards in TransportDroidIL, which in turn caused me to implement an

I hope the upcoming Ice Cream Sandwich
release fixes this.</p>

<p>Hello everyone, TransportDroidIL 1.0 will be released this month. It has quite a few new features:</p>
<ol>
<li>Separate &ldquo;Source&rdquo;, &ldquo;Destination&rdquo; and &ldquo;Time&rdquo; fields. This is much better for
auto-completion as well.</li>
<li>Automatic location-based detection of &ldquo;Source&rdquo;. Hopefully you&rsquo;ll find the
interface for this unobtrusive.</li>
<li>Quick reversal of &ldquo;Source&rdquo; and &ldquo;Destination&rdquo;, for your return trip.</li>
<li>A new settings screen, with:
<ul>
<li>Provider selection (currently Egged or MOT)</li>
<li>A small attempt at right-to-left fixes for non-supporting devices.</li>
<li>A &ldquo;clear history&rdquo; button</li>
</ul>

Ben-Yossef</a>&rsquo;s excellent Hebdroid fonts on physical
Android devices, but those don&rsquo;t really work with the Android SDK&rsquo;s emulator -
changes to the <code>system</code> directory aren&rsquo;t persistent. Here&rsquo;s how to get around
that:</p>
<p>First, a few downloads. You&rsquo;ll need:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<ol>
<li>The android emulator (presumably you already have this, if not, you can get
it at <a href="http://developer.android.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">developer.android.com</a>)</li>
<li>The <a href="http://firstpost.org/wp-content/uploads/2009/02/hebdroid.zip" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">hebdroid fonts</a></li>
<li><a href="http://code.google.com/p/unyaffs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">unyaffs</a>, which will extract the <code>system.img</code> file</li>
<li><a href="http://www.aleph1.co.uk/gitweb?p=yaffs2/.git;a=snapshot;h=69808485ec796bfa2b4806f91828281eccd0827b;sf=tgz" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">A snapshot of
yaffs2</a>,
which will create our new <code>system.img</code> file. This is actually today&rsquo;s
snapshot from the git repository, which worked for me. For later versions,
take a look at <a href="http://www.yaffs.net/node/346" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">the git repository</a>.</li>
</ol>
<p>Building <code>unyaffs</code> is simple enough, or you can use the prebuilt version from
the site. Building <code>mkyaffs2image</code> is also quite easy - just untar the
snapshot, and run <code>make</code> in the <code>utils</code> directory. Put both of these utilities
somewhere in your <code>$PATH</code> for convenience.</p>
<p>Now we can get to work. First, locate your <code>system.img</code> file. It should be
within your Android SDK directory, under <code>platforms/android-3/images</code> (or
whatever version you&rsquo;re emulating). We&rsquo;ll extract that - create a temporary
directory, say <code>/tmp/system.img.hebdroid</code>, and <code>cd</code> to it. Then run:</p>
<div class="highlight"><div class="chroma">
<table class="lntable"><tr><td class="lntd">
<pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code><span class="lnt">1
</span></code></pre></td>
<td class="lntd">
<pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-plaintext" data-lang="plaintext"><span class="line"><span class="cl">unyaffs /path/to/system.img
</span></span></code></pre></td></tr></table>
</div>
</div><p>The whole <code>/system</code> filesystem should be extracted. Now extract the <code>ttf</code> files
from <code>hebdroid.zip</code> into the fonts directory, replacing the original font
files. To pack everything back up, run:</p>
<div class="highlight"><div class="chroma">
<table class="lntable"><tr><td class="lntd">
<pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code><span class="lnt">1
</span></code></pre></td>
<td class="lntd">
<pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-plaintext" data-lang="plaintext"><span class="line"><span class="cl">mkyaffs2image /tmp/system.img.hebdroid system.img.hebdroid
</span></span></code></pre></td></tr></table>
</div>
</div><p>Now, I recommend putting renaming your original <code>system.img</code> to
<code>system.img.orig</code>, and using symlinking <code>system.img.hebdroid</code> as your new
<code>system.img</code> (the emulator does indeed follow symlinks), but you can basically
do whatever you like. You may have to recreate your AVD, but everything should
work. Happy hacking!</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve recently &ldquo;bought&rdquo; a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samsung_Galaxy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">Samsung Galaxy
Android</a> phone (the older i7500,
not the newer i9000 &ldquo;S&rdquo;) model. It&rsquo;s a seriously serious upgrade from my old
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nokia_6120_classic" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">Nokia 6120 Classic</a>, and as I
broke the 6120&rsquo;s screen and reverted back to my trusty old <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nokia_6070" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">Nokia
6070</a> (which I couldn&rsquo;t even get to
run the GMail app), I was quite a happy camper switching to a modern phone.</p>
<p>The whole idea of Android has always been very appealing to me - Nokia&rsquo;s
software has been declining in quality, and while Motorola and Samsung have
always made excellent hardware, they could never get the knack of good
software. Google has. Problem solved, right?</p>
<p>The Android software is miles ahead of anything I&rsquo;ve ever seen, including
iPhone. I now have connectivity everywhere, and apps to sync all of my favorite
things - GMail and Google Calendar are included, GTasks is great for tasks,
Paperdroid is great for Read It Later, NewsRob is great for Google Reader. The
Facebook and Twidroyd applications are also quite nice, and the convenience has
me using those networks more. I even have nifty stuff like Transdroid, a
Transmission web client which is actually very good at <strong>adding</strong> torrents
while I&rsquo;m away, so they&rsquo;re done by the time I get home. I get my reading done
with Aldiko and ACV (for comics). Even Israeli sites have some good
applications up, such as YNet and <a href="http://d.co.il/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">Dapei Zahav</a> have a nice
Android app, though not as nice as their iPhone ones. And of course, there&rsquo;s
the wonderful <a href="http://waze.co.il/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">Waze</a>, which is the most Israeli solution to
the road congestion problem I&rsquo;ve ever seen. I&rsquo;ve even had the chance to do some
on-foot navigation with Google Maps, which is also handy.</p>
<p>The phone itself has a beautiful AMOLED screen, great audio quality (comes with
quite a good set of headphones as well), and looks sleek. The touchscreen is
responsive enough (though not anywhere near new Android devices nor the
iPhone/iPod touch), and it even comes with a free extra 8GB SD card, for a
total of 16GB.</p>
<p>And now, to rant.</p>
<p>Battery life isn&rsquo;t what is should be - the phone is awesome, I want to use it,
and it can barely get through the day - especially if I&rsquo;m doing heavy stuff
like Waze (GPS + Data + screen is always on + voice), but even if I&rsquo;m just
surfing casually. The unlock button is located inconveniently on the bottom
part of the right side, just above the camera button. The home button is
located between the Back and Send buttons, meaning it&rsquo;s very easy to hit by
accident; it&rsquo;s not even labeled. The CPU isn&rsquo;t always fast enough to keep
everything completely smooth, and while this is generally acceptable, it gets
rather irksome in odd places: If you turn on screen auto-rotation (which uses
more battery power), rotation takes a while and might be accidental. However,
there is no <em>manual</em> screen rotation option as far as I can tell.</p>
<p>As a music player (relating to my previous post), the device works well enough -
but I couldn&rsquo;t, for the life of me, get Hebrew support in ID3 tags (no matter
what the encoding is), and only a limited subset of ID3 tag versions is
supported, and everything works much better with Ogg files.</p>
<p>The flaws I&rsquo;ve mentioned are relatively minor and nitpicky - for Waze, you can
use the car charger (which comes with the phone, thankfully). The buttons are
OK after some getting used to (and installing the excellent AnySoftKeyboard),
and operation is generally smooth. However, there is a major issue I can&rsquo;t wrap
my head around - the shipped firmware is 1.5 cupcake, and there are absolutely
zero updates available from Samsung. There is a semi-official leaked 1.6 update
which, as I&rsquo;ve heard, is quite buggy. An awesome guy called
<a href="http://www.drakaz.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">drakaz</a> has been working on a Froyo (2.2) port for the
Galaxy, which I really should check out, but Samsung&rsquo;s behavior on this topic
is inexcusable in my opinion.</p>
<p>All-in-all, however, I&rsquo;m happy with my phone. It&rsquo;s a joy to use, and the price
is hard to beat - free with my phone plan, provided I can rake up a bill of
150₪ (which I can, with some help from the 70₪ 1GB data plan, which comes in
quite handy). My next phone will, however, probably not be a Samsung.</p>
