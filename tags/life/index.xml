For some people, it&amp;rsquo;s housework or schoolwork which gets drowned out by day-to-day life. For others it&amp;rsquo;s keeping up with friends and family. Myself, I also like to read and write.
Writing, for me, is usually about practical stuff. Sometimes it&amp;rsquo;s simply code (most of those projects were written on vacations).</description></item><item><title>That "Life" category there</title><link>https://lutzky.net/2008/07/11/that-life-category-there/</link><pubDate>Fri, 11 Jul 2008 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://lutzky.net/2008/07/11/that-life-category-there/</guid><description>I has it. Sorta.
A few weeks ago, the lovely NaNuchKa visited Israel for two and a half shows (the half-show was warming for Berry Sacharof). &amp;ldquo;Three shows in two weeks?&amp;rdquo;, people ask - well, yeah. They only come once a year. Their set is already too long to play all the songs I like, and that&amp;rsquo;s actually quite excellent - new EP and all. Great stuff :) Deep Purple should be coming to Israel this summer (holy crap!</description></item><item><title>Means of control</title><link>https://lutzky.net/2007/12/17/means-of-control/</link><pubDate>Mon, 17 Dec 2007 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://lutzky.net/2007/12/17/means-of-control/</guid><description>New URL - not interesting. You&amp;rsquo;d notice by now, as you&amp;rsquo;ve been redirected. Guess my new E-mail. OpenID - interesting, but I don&amp;rsquo;t have anything particularily interesting to say about it right now.
This, however, is interesting: &amp;ldquo;10 things christians and atheists can (and must) agree on&amp;rdquo;, a nicely written piece over at cracked.com. But this isn&amp;rsquo;t blogspam, I&amp;rsquo;ll actually share my two cents. (or shnekel, if you like)
I have a serious problem with religion; It is my opinion that it is an overly powerful means of control.</description></item><item><title>Vacation</title><link>https://lutzky.net/2007/11/04/vacation/</link><pubDate>Sun, 04 Nov 2007 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://lutzky.net/2007/11/04/vacation/</guid><description>The most recent events in my life which I would consider to be vacations would be the second Lebanon war and my basic training. I love the Technion, but I think it&amp;rsquo;s high time for some R&amp;amp;R. With no upcoming tests hovering over my head, homework pressure low-to-nonexistent, and my girlfriend&amp;rsquo;s birthday Murphy&amp;rsquo;s-law-bendingly coinciding with her getting some leave, this is a perfect opportunity to try my hand at a real vacation.</description></item><item><title>Tough Question</title><link>https://lutzky.net/2007/09/25/tough-question/</link><pubDate>Tue, 25 Sep 2007 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://lutzky.net/2007/09/25/tough-question/</guid><description>My girlfriend just asked me what just might be the hardest question I&amp;rsquo;ve heard all semester; What do I like better, The Simpsons or beer?</description></item><item><title>Some things make you feel good</title><link>https://lutzky.net/2007/07/23/some-things-make-you-feel-good/</link><pubDate>Mon, 23 Jul 2007 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://lutzky.net/2007/07/23/some-things-make-you-feel-good/</guid><description>Some things renew your faith in people, in the time you spend with them. Amazingly small things, considering their grand scope. Making things worse is known to be easy, and rebuilding is one of the hardest things we have to do in life. But sometimes, when things turn out to be completely different than they seem - new perspective is gained, old perspective is found again, and like something out of an old Disney cartoon, kitschy clouds of gloom make way for kitschy rays of sunshine.</description></item><item><title>On the matter of a really long vacation</title><link>https://lutzky.net/2007/04/24/on-the-matter-of-a-really-long-vacation/</link><pubDate>Tue, 24 Apr 2007 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://lutzky.net/2007/04/24/on-the-matter-of-a-really-long-vacation/</guid><description>By now I&amp;rsquo;ve lost count of how long ago my last class was. The strike has begun immediately after passover, and is certainly beginning to take its toll. For one thing, I have no homework deadlines - a rare situation indeed for the Technion student. Furthermore, contemplations are rising about whether or not this coming summer semester will be held, as the current semester will most likely leak into it. This is of special interest to me, as I&amp;rsquo;m behind on my degree, which is problematic because of my military scholarship.</description></item><item><title>Courtney Love on Piracy</title><link>https://lutzky.net/2007/02/02/courtney-love-on-piracy/</link><pubDate>Fri, 02 Feb 2007 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://lutzky.net/2007/02/02/courtney-love-on-piracy/</guid><description>This is absolutely antique (2000), but it&amp;rsquo;s good to hear an artist with a clue.
