management course teaches you about: important, but not urgent. For some
people, it&amp;rsquo;s housework or schoolwork which gets drowned out by day-to-day life.
For others it&amp;rsquo;s keeping up with friends and family. Myself, I also like to
&lt;em>read&lt;/em> and &lt;em>write&lt;/em>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Writing, for me, is usually about practical stuff. Sometimes it&amp;rsquo;s simply
&lt;a href="https://github.com/lutzky" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">code&lt;/a> (most of those projects were written on
vacations). Other times, it&amp;rsquo;s writing to this blog (in one of its
incarnations) - which usually has to do with technical tinkering of some sort
or other. It&amp;rsquo;s not that I don&amp;rsquo;t do enough writing in my day job; but there does
tend to be an accumulation of things to write: &amp;ldquo;I should blog about that&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;I
should write that code&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;I should try and get my router to do that&amp;rdquo;, and so
forth. When a few days off come by, and I feel that I have enough time to get
more urgent stuff done - it&amp;rsquo;s quite satisfying to be able to dig into that
write-queue.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>That "Life" category there</title><link>https://lutzky.net/posts/that-life-category-there/</link><pubDate>Fri, 11 Jul 2008 11:58:00 +0000</pubDate><author>lutzky@gmail.com (Ohad Lutzky)</author><guid>https://lutzky.net/posts/that-life-category-there/</guid><description>&lt;p>I has it. Sorta.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A few weeks ago, the lovely &lt;a href="http://nanuchka.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">NaNuchKa&lt;/a> visited Israel for
two and a half shows (the half-show was warming for Berry Sacharof). &amp;ldquo;Three
shows in two weeks?&amp;rdquo;, people ask - well, yeah. They only come once a year.
Their set is already too long to play &lt;a href="http://youtube.com/watch?v=tn4RITTXkjw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">all the songs I
like&lt;/a>, and that&amp;rsquo;s actually quite
excellent - new EP and all. Great stuff :) Deep Purple should be coming to
Israel this summer (holy crap!), and I need to see what I can do about getting
tickets for that.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Means of control</title><link>https://lutzky.net/posts/means-of-control/</link><pubDate>Mon, 17 Dec 2007 01:47:00 +0000</pubDate><author>lutzky@gmail.com (Ohad Lutzky)</author><guid>https://lutzky.net/posts/means-of-control/</guid><description>&lt;p>New URL - not interesting. You&amp;rsquo;d notice by now, as you&amp;rsquo;ve been redirected.
Guess my new E-mail. OpenID - interesting, but I don&amp;rsquo;t have anything
particularily interesting to say about it right now.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This, however, &lt;em>is&lt;/em> interesting: &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href="http://www.cracked.com/article_15663_god-fuse-10-things-christians-atheists-can-must-agree-on.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">10 things christians and atheists can (and

blogspam, I&amp;rsquo;ll actually share my two cents. (or

be the second Lebanon war and my basic training. I love the Technion, but I
think it&amp;rsquo;s high time for some R&amp;amp;R. With no upcoming tests hovering over my
head, homework pressure low-to-nonexistent, and my girlfriend&amp;rsquo;s birthday
Murphy&amp;rsquo;s-law-bendingly coinciding with her getting some leave, this is a
perfect opportunity to try my hand at a real vacation.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Tough Question</title><link>https://lutzky.net/posts/tough-question/</link><pubDate>Tue, 25 Sep 2007 18:29:00 +0000</pubDate><author>lutzky@gmail.com (Ohad Lutzky)</author><guid>https://lutzky.net/posts/tough-question/</guid><description>&lt;p>My girlfriend just asked me what just might be the hardest question I&amp;rsquo;ve heard
all semester; What do I like better, The Simpsons or beer?&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Some things make you feel good</title><link>https://lutzky.net/posts/some-things-make-you-feel-good/</link><pubDate>Mon, 23 Jul 2007 00:26:00 +0000</pubDate><author>lutzky@gmail.com (Ohad Lutzky)</author><guid>https://lutzky.net/posts/some-things-make-you-feel-good/</guid><description>&lt;p>Some things renew your faith in people, in the time you spend with them.
Amazingly small things, considering their grand scope. Making things worse is
known to be easy, and rebuilding is one of the hardest things we have to do in
life. But sometimes, when things turn out to be completely different than they
seem - new perspective is gained, old perspective is found again, and like
something out of an old Disney cartoon, kitschy clouds of gloom make way for
kitschy rays of sunshine. Complete with the smiling sun and everything. Like
freakin&amp;rsquo; Roger Rabbit :)&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>On the matter of a really long vacation</title><link>https://lutzky.net/posts/on-the-matter-of-a-really-long-vacation/</link><pubDate>Tue, 24 Apr 2007 22:14:00 +0000</pubDate><author>lutzky@gmail.com (Ohad Lutzky)</author><guid>https://lutzky.net/posts/on-the-matter-of-a-really-long-vacation/</guid><description>&lt;p>By now I&amp;rsquo;ve lost count of how long ago my last class was. The strike has begun
immediately after passover, and is certainly beginning to take its toll. For
one thing, I have no homework deadlines - a rare situation indeed for the
Technion student. Furthermore, contemplations are rising about whether or not
this coming summer semester will be held, as the current semester will most
likely leak into it. This is of special interest to me, as I&amp;rsquo;m behind on my
degree, which is problematic because of my military scholarship. This is
shaping up to be the second time in which, while I&amp;rsquo;ve been authorized by the
military to take a summer semester for completion, I am not able to. However,
one cannot trivially dismiss this strike; in a country which is known worldwide
mostly for its technological exports and frequent bloodbaths, one shouldn&amp;rsquo;t
take the matter of tuition lightly.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Courtney Love on Piracy</title><link>https://lutzky.net/posts/courtney-love-on-piracy/</link><pubDate>Fri, 02 Feb 2007 01:12:00 +0000</pubDate><author>lutzky@gmail.com (Ohad Lutzky)</author><guid>https://lutzky.net/posts/courtney-love-on-piracy/</guid><description>&lt;p>This is absolutely antique (2000), but it&amp;rsquo;s good to hear an artist with a clue.&lt;/p>
