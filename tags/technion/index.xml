Sorta.
A few weeks ago, the lovely NaNuchKa visited Israel for two and a half shows (the half-show was warming for Berry Sacharof). &amp;ldquo;Three shows in two weeks?&amp;rdquo;, people ask - well, yeah. They only come once a year. Their set is already too long to play all the songs I like, and that&amp;rsquo;s actually quite excellent - new EP and all. Great stuff :) Deep Purple should be coming to Israel this summer (holy crap!</description></item><item><title>Computability - Typed Lectures and Tutorials</title><link>https://lutzky.net/2007/10/31/computability-typed-lectures-and-tutorials/</link><pubDate>Wed, 31 Oct 2007 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://lutzky.net/2007/10/31/computability-typed-lectures-and-tutorials/</guid><description>All links in this post have been lost to the mists of time. I&amp;rsquo;ve kept it here out of pure nostalgia.
I&amp;rsquo;m typing the lectures of the course 236343 Computability Theory this semester. Attached are my lectures notes in PDF form:

If you also type the notes and would like to collaborate with me, I use a git repository stored here:

The strike has begun immediately after passover, and is certainly beginning to take its toll. For one thing, I have no homework deadlines - a rare situation indeed for the Technion student. Furthermore, contemplations are rising about whether or not this coming summer semester will be held, as the current semester will most likely leak into it. This is of special interest to me, as I&amp;rsquo;m behind on my degree, which is problematic because of my military scholarship.</description></item><item><title>Using Jabber from within the Technion</title><link>https://lutzky.net/2007/02/27/using-jabber-from-within-the-technion/</link><pubDate>Tue, 27 Feb 2007 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://lutzky.net/2007/02/27/using-jabber-from-within-the-technion/</guid><description>A very neat find for those of you who want to use Jabber from within the Technion, but with your client of choice rather than a web-based one: Many Jabber servers, including Google Talk, support using Port 443 over SSL. Since the Technion does not block outbound SSL connections, this will work there as well. Be sure to mark the appropriate &amp;lsquo;Use old SSL protocol&amp;rsquo; option in your jabber client (that&amp;rsquo;s what it&amp;rsquo;s called in gaim and pidgin, at any rate).</description></item><item><title>Here's hoping</title><link>https://lutzky.net/2007/02/14/heres-hoping/</link><pubDate>Wed, 14 Feb 2007 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://lutzky.net/2007/02/14/heres-hoping/</guid><description>def factor(grade, params = {}) return 100 if params.empty? # Optimistic, eh? case params[:type] when :pass return 55 when :fail return 54 when :root params[:gamma] = 0.5 end grade = grade.to_f return params[:proc].call(grade) if params[:proc] grade *= params[:coefficient] if params[:coefficient] if params[:gamma] grade /= 100 grade **= params[:gamma] grade *= 100 end if params[:offset] grade += params[:offset] end return grade if params[:idnoclip] [ grade, 100 ].min end</description></item><item><title>I might need these tomorrow...</title><link>https://lutzky.net/2007/01/30/i-might-need-these-tomorrow/</link><pubDate>Tue, 30 Jan 2007 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://lutzky.net/2007/01/30/i-might-need-these-tomorrow/</guid><description>My lecture slides.

Ruby is sometimes called the Japanese Python, and comparisons are inevitable. I know very little about Python, but I do know that&amp;hellip;
It has a larger community More GUI applications are written in it More bindings are available for it Its interpreter is much faster Not a far inferior language Ruby certainly does have its advantages over it - trivial class expansion, extremely concise syntax, seemingly better-suited for heavy usage of closures, and Matz.</description></item></channel></rss>
