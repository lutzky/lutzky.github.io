Sorta.</p>
<p>A few weeks ago, the lovely <a href="http://nanuchka.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">NaNuchKa</a> visited Israel for
two and a half shows (the half-show was warming for Berry Sacharof). &ldquo;Three
shows in two weeks?&rdquo;, people ask - well, yeah. They only come once a year.
Their set is already too long to play <a href="http://youtube.com/watch?v=tn4RITTXkjw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">all the songs I
like</a>, and that&rsquo;s actually quite
excellent - new EP and all. Great stuff :) Deep Purple should be coming to
Israel this summer (holy crap!), and I need to see what I can do about getting
tickets for that.</p>
<p>This is my last semester at the Technion - then it&rsquo;s off to the military for
me. Courses for this semester are Electronic Switching Circuits (bleh&hellip;),
Signals and Systems (which is actually turning out to be quite awesome!), and
the neat Compilation Theory. After having thoroughly enjoyed <a href="http://www.cs.technion.ac.il/~biham/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">Eli
Biham</a>&rsquo;s excellent Modern Cryptology last
semester, I&rsquo;m visiting (but not taking) his advanced topics course this
semester. I also have two projects: One in computer security, where we mess
with Google, and another in EE, where we try using transactional memory in
order to optimize Apache.</p>
<p>And finally - next week on Thursday, Shlomi Shaban is doing a piano show in
Haifa, just like the good old days. He was supposed to join NaNuchKa for one of
their shows, but had to cancel, so my lovely lady (who introduced me to his
work in the first place) and I haven&rsquo;t been to his shows in quite a while. It
seems that will be able to use the new <a href="http://www.egged.co.il/main.asp?lngCategoryID=6109" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">200
line</a> - part of a long
overdue project to have cheap public transportation available all night long.</p>

The strike has begun
immediately after passover, and is certainly beginning to take its toll. For
one thing, I have no homework deadlines - a rare situation indeed for the
Technion student. Furthermore, contemplations are rising about whether or not
this coming summer semester will be held, as the current semester will most
likely leak into it. This is of special interest to me, as I&rsquo;m behind on my
degree, which is problematic because of my military scholarship. This is
shaping up to be the second time in which, while I&rsquo;ve been authorized by the
military to take a summer semester for completion, I am not able to. However,
one cannot trivially dismiss this strike; in a country which is known worldwide
mostly for its technological exports and frequent bloodbaths, one shouldn&rsquo;t
take the matter of tuition lightly.</p>
<p>The vacation was not, however, boring - I got to spend a lot of time with my
lovely girlfriend, a chance to see friends I have not seen in a long time, and
a lot of posts racked up in various forums. The vacation actually expanded far
enough to contain independence day, so I managed to experience the closest
thing to a hangover I&rsquo;d ever had (But that was some great scotch). Actually,
independence day could have been truly superb; the whole thing got me thinking
about what the perfect night out would be: It&rsquo;s obviously best with my
girlfriend. It would probably start with a rock show of sorts, continue with
food and beer, and end in my girlfriend&rsquo;s bed. Better yet - if I&rsquo;m <em>in</em> the
show. Better still - if there&rsquo;s no reason to get up early the following day.</p>
<p>Another item of interest is that I&rsquo;ve joined a band. Hopefully I&rsquo;ll be able to
keep up the 3-hours-on-Saturday rehearsals. It&rsquo;s a &ldquo;Trash Metal&rdquo; band which has
evidently had really bad experience with bass players. Unfortunately, we seem
to have a <a href="http://myspace.com/switchblade777" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">myspace page</a>. It looks&hellip;
myspaceish. However, I really think the group has potential, as well as
excellent influences. Furthermore, I&rsquo;m an attention whore :D. Hopefully I&rsquo;ll be
able to help influence the band into more of a heavy-metal direction by
harassing them with melodic basslines.</p>
<p>Very little geek news this time, other than the fact that <a href="http://ubuntu.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">Feisty
Fawn</a> is out. My verdict - get it. It&rsquo;s awesome. Period.
Suspend works much better, NetworkManager is now installed by default, a lot of
things have really been polished, and - can you believe it - Sudoku :)! If you
already run Ubuntu, I&rsquo;d advise against using the update manager - it works, but
it takes a long time, and cannot run unattended. Also, a word of caution to
server admins though - sqlite3 is the new default, so if you have sqlite2
databases you&rsquo;ll need to convert them (use the sqlite and sqlite3 binaries to
do this) - otherwise you&rsquo;ll get &ldquo;file is not a database, or is encrypted&rdquo;
errors.</p>
<p>Whew - that&rsquo;s much better. My thoughts have been depleted into the bits and
bytes before you. I&rsquo;ll just <a href="http://gadial.net" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">plug a friend&rsquo;s blog</a> and hit
the publish button now ;)</p>

Technion, but with your client of choice rather than a web-based one: Many
Jabber servers, including Google Talk, support using Port 443 over SSL. Since
the Technion does not block outbound SSL connections, this will work there as
well. Be sure to mark the appropriate &lsquo;Use old SSL protocol&rsquo; option in your
jabber client (that&rsquo;s what it&rsquo;s called in gaim and pidgin, at any rate).</p>

that I&rsquo;m using a php-based blog&hellip; you get the picture. Ruby is sometimes
called the Japanese Python, and comparisons are inevitable. I know very little
about Python, but I do know that&hellip;</p>
<ul>
<li>It has a larger community</li>
<li>More GUI applications are written in it</li>
<li>More bindings are available for it</li>
<li>Its interpreter is much faster</li>
<li>Not a far inferior language</li>
</ul>
<p>Ruby certainly does have its advantages over it - trivial class expansion,
extremely concise syntax, seemingly better-suited for heavy usage of closures,
and Matz. Ya gotta love Matz.</p>
<p>I will be giving Python a try soon&hellip; I love learning new programming
languages. That&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m taking Programming Languages this coming semester.</p>
