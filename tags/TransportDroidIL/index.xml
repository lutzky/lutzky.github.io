utility to query Israeli public transportation sites more easily using an
Android phone.</p>
<p>Source control is super important. Mistakes will be made, other coders will
want to join in, and experimental features will want to be in their own
branches. <a href="http://git-scm.com/">Git</a> is awesome; it does source control
<em>right</em>, gives me powerful tools, and isn&rsquo;t a hassle to set up - even for a
small project like this. <a href="http://github.com/">Github</a> is also awesome; it makes
collaboration with other coders - even just one, in my case - easy, organized,
and fun.</p>
<p>One of my favorite git features is <em>revert</em>. It allows you to automatically
inverse a previous change. Here&rsquo;s an example from TransportDroidIL:
<a href="https://github.com/lutzky/TransportDroidIL/commit/0e194de5b8f24f85a3b4931963a06743525dacf8">0e194de</a>.
This commit reverts a previous &ldquo;cleanup&rdquo; commit in the autocompletion code -
allegedly, I was keeping two copies of the autocompletion option list for no
reason: One as a <code>LinkedList&lt;string&gt;</code>, and one internal to the
AutoCompleteTextView which I can access via an <code>ArrayAdapter&lt;string&gt;</code>. Turns out
that my <code>LinkedList&lt;string&gt;</code> copy is necessary, because the <code>ArrayAdapter&lt;string&gt;</code>
always behaves as though it&rsquo;s empty, so it cannot truly be read from. Despite
having performed a few commits since that bad &ldquo;fix&rdquo;, git was very helpful in
letting me revert that particular change, showing me the conflicts this
operation causes, and allowing me to fix them. The lesson is an important one:
Make small, manageable commits. Git is optimized for this, as commits are local
(no need to contact the server until a <em>push</em>).</p>
<p>Developing for Android makes a lot of sense when using Eclipse. I&rsquo;m a VIM
junkie, and generally dislike IDEs. Eclipse is slow and heavy - but it gets the
job done, and it does it very well. It&rsquo;s a bit weird that a plugin is required
to manage color schemes - but it exists. It&rsquo;s <strong>very</strong> weird (and quite
annoying) that it doesn&rsquo;t remove end-of-line white-space, and doesn&rsquo;t have an
option to do this. This makes git complain. There <em>is</em> an option to add
&ldquo;clean-up&rdquo; settings which are activated on every save, but this is far too
cumbersome and might change code I didn&rsquo;t intend to change (which becomes
confusing in the revision log). Still, the excellent debugging, JUnit and
logcat support are worth it.</p>
<p>Logcat is another awesome feature of Android. Every logged line has both a
&ldquo;Tag&rdquo; (usually defined per-class) and a severity. Logs can be filtered with a
different severity for each tag, and still - one can use the same logcat to
show messages from anything running on the Android device at the moment. It&rsquo;s
basically Syslog done better.</p>
<p>One last point is about Hebrew. This has been a problem with Android for quite
a while; for example, in a stock Android 2.3.3, numbers embedded in Hebrew
string appear backwards. Fixes exist, and are implemented in most Israeli ROMs,
especially the ones distributed by phone carriers - but they&rsquo;re different, and
sometimes don&rsquo;t work for all applications. This causes numbers to appear
backwards in TransportDroidIL, which in turn caused me to implement an
<a href="https://github.com/lutzky/TransportDroidIL/commit/713a9bd89547763776bb8a1c991ceb23bd6426c5">ugly</a> <a href="https://github.com/lutzky/TransportDroidIL/commit/6ba21053a8e981882bd0b1f808f257979a2bf488">hack</a>. I hope the upcoming Ice Cream Sandwich
release fixes this.</p>

It has quite a few new features:
Separate &amp;ldquo;Source&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;Destination&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Time&amp;rdquo; fields. This is much better for auto-completion as well. Automatic location-based detection of &amp;ldquo;Source&amp;rdquo;. Hopefully you&amp;rsquo;ll find the interface for this unobtrusive. Quick reversal of &amp;ldquo;Source&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Destination&amp;rdquo;, for your return trip.
