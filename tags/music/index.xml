Sorta.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A few weeks ago, the lovely &lt;a href="http://nanuchka.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">NaNuchKa&lt;/a> visited Israel for
two and a half shows (the half-show was warming for Berry Sacharof). &amp;ldquo;Three
shows in two weeks?&amp;rdquo;, people ask - well, yeah. They only come once a year.
Their set is already too long to play &lt;a href="http://youtube.com/watch?v=tn4RITTXkjw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">all the songs I
like&lt;/a>, and that&amp;rsquo;s actually quite
excellent - new EP and all. Great stuff :) Deep Purple should be coming to
Israel this summer (holy crap!), and I need to see what I can do about getting
tickets for that.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>NaNuchKa</title><link>https://lutzky.net/posts/nanuchka/</link><pubDate>Fri, 27 Jul 2007 10:48:00 +0000</pubDate><author>lutzky@gmail.com (Ohad Lutzky)</author><guid>https://lutzky.net/posts/nanuchka/</guid><description>&lt;p>Despite having a critical midterm Sunday, as well as being sick, I could not,
and should not have, give up on the &lt;a href="http://myspace.com/nanuchka" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">NaNuchKa&lt;/a>
show. Some of the best music I&amp;rsquo;ve ever heard, no doubt, and with the
unexpectedly intimate setting, I had the opportunity to get to know the truly
incredible Yula after the show. They&amp;rsquo;re playing in Tel-Aviv today, at the
Koltura, where I was supposed to&amp;hellip; Fantastic music, at any rate. Keep your
ears open!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Some music posted to myspace</title><link>https://lutzky.net/posts/some-music-posted-to-myspace/</link><pubDate>Sat, 02 Jun 2007 22:44:00 +0000</pubDate><author>lutzky@gmail.com (Ohad Lutzky)</author><guid>https://lutzky.net/posts/some-music-posted-to-myspace/</guid><description>&lt;p>Recording this morning was excellent! Awesome studio, not expensive at all, and
a whole lot of fun. We&amp;rsquo;ve posted one song at &lt;a href="http://myspace.com/switchblade777" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">our myspace
page&lt;/a>, and it seems that Lior has found an
apt name for the CD (hint) ;)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For those of you who don&amp;rsquo;t want to visit Myspace (can&amp;rsquo;t blame you), here&amp;rsquo;s the
song we posted, as well as an extra track (my personal favorite), Falsely
Accused.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Some band stuff</title><link>https://lutzky.net/posts/some-band-stuff/</link><pubDate>Thu, 31 May 2007 22:20:00 +0000</pubDate><author>lutzky@gmail.com (Ohad Lutzky)</author><guid>https://lutzky.net/posts/some-band-stuff/</guid><description>&lt;p>This Saturday we&amp;rsquo;re going to record our material, and hopefully a cover we&amp;rsquo;ve
been working on - Venom&amp;rsquo;s excellent &amp;ldquo;School Daze&amp;rdquo;. We took some photos
yesterday, visible here:

And as a technology enthusiast, there are many
new and cool things to see online. For example, there&amp;rsquo;s the new
&lt;a href="http://schools.whatsup.org.il" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">Schools&lt;/a> site, part of the Vaya project which
helps Israeli schools use Linux; this site uses the up-and-coming
&lt;a href="http://lahak.python-hosting.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">Lahak&lt;/a> CMS, built on the Django framework,
and looks very promising to the eyes of the bidi-lingual webmaster.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>However, some things just plain suck. One of them is myspace; today, in an
attempt to make it more legible, I found that &lt;a href="http://myspace.com/switchblade777" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">My Band&amp;rsquo;s
Page&lt;/a> implements all of its styling changes
by a &amp;ldquo;style&amp;rdquo; tag hidden within the &amp;ldquo;Members&amp;rdquo; text block. Myspace doesn&amp;rsquo;t filter
this out - nor does it provide any other means of changing the styling. This,
combined with myspace&amp;rsquo;s horrid administration interface, makes editing
incredible unwieldy. I&amp;rsquo;m considering opening another Wordpress site for the
band here on this server&amp;hellip;&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>On the matter of a really long vacation</title><link>https://lutzky.net/posts/on-the-matter-of-a-really-long-vacation/</link><pubDate>Tue, 24 Apr 2007 22:14:00 +0000</pubDate><author>lutzky@gmail.com (Ohad Lutzky)</author><guid>https://lutzky.net/posts/on-the-matter-of-a-really-long-vacation/</guid><description>&lt;p>By now I&amp;rsquo;ve lost count of how long ago my last class was. The strike has begun
immediately after passover, and is certainly beginning to take its toll. For
one thing, I have no homework deadlines - a rare situation indeed for the
Technion student. Furthermore, contemplations are rising about whether or not
this coming summer semester will be held, as the current semester will most
likely leak into it. This is of special interest to me, as I&amp;rsquo;m behind on my
degree, which is problematic because of my military scholarship. This is
shaping up to be the second time in which, while I&amp;rsquo;ve been authorized by the
military to take a summer semester for completion, I am not able to. However,
one cannot trivially dismiss this strike; in a country which is known worldwide
mostly for its technological exports and frequent bloodbaths, one shouldn&amp;rsquo;t
take the matter of tuition lightly.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Bass guitar</title><link>https://lutzky.net/posts/bass-guitar/</link><pubDate>Sun, 25 Feb 2007 21:17:00 +0000</pubDate><author>lutzky@gmail.com (Ohad Lutzky)</author><guid>https://lutzky.net/posts/bass-guitar/</guid><description>&lt;p>I brought my Fender Squier Jazz Bass up to my Technion apartment. I hope it
won&amp;rsquo;t have too much of an adverse effect on my studying&amp;hellip; playing it (loud) is
great for stress, and I&amp;rsquo;m taking a jazz improvisation course next semester.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>By the way - if any of you record with one of these, I highly recommend
&lt;a href="http://ardour.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">Arour&lt;/a>, using a low-pass LADSPA filter. Also, activating
both pickups on about 80% does wonders against hum if you connect directly.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
