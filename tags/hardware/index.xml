First order of business -
get a working internet connection. This is extra-challenging when your
primary machine doesn&amp;rsquo;t even have a wireless network card.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>My first hack used my trusty laptop - it has a properly working wireless card,
and could connect to my roommate&amp;rsquo;s router quite easily. It runs Ubuntu, and as
it turns out, that means sharing the connection was dead-simple: Right-click on
the network manager icon, add a new wired connection called &amp;ldquo;Shared&amp;rdquo;, and under
IPv4 settings, choose &amp;ldquo;Shared to other computers&amp;rdquo;. That&amp;rsquo;s it. Once I connected
my desktop to my laptop, it automatically got all of its settings, and I was
good to go.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Android</title><link>https://lutzky.net/posts/android/</link><pubDate>Sat, 04 Sep 2010 09:26:00 +0000</pubDate><author>lutzky@gmail.com (Ohad Lutzky)</author><guid>https://lutzky.net/posts/android/</guid><description>&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ve finally gotten the chance to get one of those newfangled Android phones.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ve recently &amp;ldquo;bought&amp;rdquo; a &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samsung_Galaxy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">Samsung Galaxy
Android&lt;/a> phone (the older i7500,
not the newer i9000 &amp;ldquo;S&amp;rdquo;) model. It&amp;rsquo;s a seriously serious upgrade from my old
&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nokia_6120_classic" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">Nokia 6120 Classic&lt;/a>, and as I
broke the 6120&amp;rsquo;s screen and reverted back to my trusty old &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nokia_6070" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">Nokia
6070&lt;/a> (which I couldn&amp;rsquo;t even get to
run the GMail app), I was quite a happy camper switching to a modern phone.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>My music player has sunk</title><link>https://lutzky.net/posts/my-music-player-has-sunk/</link><pubDate>Sat, 13 Mar 2010 16:35:00 +0000</pubDate><author>lutzky@gmail.com (Ohad Lutzky)</author><guid>https://lutzky.net/posts/my-music-player-has-sunk/</guid><description>&lt;p>My &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meizu_M6_miniPlayer" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">Meizu Mini M6&lt;/a> has died a
tragic death as a result of being left in my shirt pocket, which in turn was -
with the rest of my shirt - in the laundry. I&amp;rsquo;ve had it for three years, so
this would be a good time to review.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>My favorite thing about the Mini was the cost. When I bought it, it was far
cheaper than comparable players, at ~400â‚ª for 8GB. For a player with good video
support, it was a steal. Other pros it had include:&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Broken phone screen - data rescue</title><link>https://lutzky.net/posts/broken-phone-screen-data-rescue/</link><pubDate>Sat, 31 Oct 2009 02:32:00 +0000</pubDate><author>lutzky@gmail.com (Ohad Lutzky)</author><guid>https://lutzky.net/posts/broken-phone-screen-data-rescue/</guid><description>&lt;p>Last weekend I broke my Nokia 6120&amp;rsquo;s screen. I have a military phone, which is
far cheaper, so I&amp;rsquo;ve decided to keep it offline. However, being the sentimental
guy that I am, I did want to save all of my contacts and SMS messages (in
addition to the photos, which presented less of a problem). This proved to be a
bit of a challenge without the screen working.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Usually, when you connect the phone via USB, it asks if you want &amp;ldquo;PC Suite
mode&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;Data Transfer mode&amp;rdquo;. The &amp;ldquo;Data Transfer&amp;rdquo; mode has the phone show up
as a standard USB storage device, which allows for easy transfer of MP3 files,
photos and videos to and from the phone, without any nokia-specific software.
However, it only works for the external SD card, so you can&amp;rsquo;t use that to
access SMS messages or contacts.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Hardware doesn't like me</title><link>https://lutzky.net/posts/hardware-doesnt-like-me/</link><pubDate>Thu, 26 Feb 2009 22:15:00 +0000</pubDate><author>lutzky@gmail.com (Ohad Lutzky)</author><guid>https://lutzky.net/posts/hardware-doesnt-like-me/</guid><description>Whenever I try messing with hardware at home, inexplicable failures ensue.

I could play it
just about anywhere, and battery life - for the time - was great. I lost it at
one point, and replaced it with a &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_gear" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">Game
Gear&lt;/a>, which sucked the life out of 6
AA batteries rather quickly. The &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_Boy_Color" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">Game Boy
Color&lt;/a> was actually decent on
battery life, but since it didn&amp;rsquo;t have a backlight, you had to play it at very
specific angles.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Nokia 6120 Classic</title><link>https://lutzky.net/posts/nokia-6120-classic/</link><pubDate>Mon, 11 Feb 2008 14:03:00 +0000</pubDate><author>lutzky@gmail.com (Ohad Lutzky)</author><guid>https://lutzky.net/posts/nokia-6120-classic/</guid><description>&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ve switched to a &lt;a href="http://europe.nokia.com/A4399010" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">Nokia 6120 Classic&lt;/a>, and
I&amp;rsquo;ve switched my carrier over to Orange. I&amp;rsquo;m very happy with it: The price is
right, at 0 NIS a month (if your monthly bill adds up to over 100 NIS without
it, which it does). It&amp;rsquo;s very small, but has a nice screen and a respectable 2
megapixel camera. It&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;3.5G&amp;rdquo;, which means it has a very fast internet
connection (I&amp;rsquo;ve clocked over 50kbyte/sec), and the Symbian S60 operating
system lets me use it well - it comes with a very, very nice webkit-based
browser and RSS reader, and a fast GMail client is a few clicks away.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Before reinstalling your server for RAID</title><link>https://lutzky.net/posts/before-reinstalling-your-server-for-raid/</link><pubDate>Mon, 26 Feb 2007 16:26:00 +0000</pubDate><author>lutzky@gmail.com (Ohad Lutzky)</author><guid>https://lutzky.net/posts/before-reinstalling-your-server-for-raid/</guid><description>&lt;p>Check that the RAID it supports is actual Raid. My experience today:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Decide that secondary server should gradually become more and more primary&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Decide that since it has two 160GB hard drives and built-in RAID, we should use that for mirroring&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Mail (both!) users of the secondary server that it&amp;rsquo;ll be down for rebuilding&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Set up RAID array from BIOS, clearing all old information&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Insert installation CD&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Notice that installation still sees two hard drives&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Discover that built-in NVRaid is actually software RAID&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Disable built in RAID in favor of LVM, proceed to reinstall :(&lt;/li>
