I work on code in my own git clone, and ask a peer to review it. It works somewhat like this:
master branch is same code as currently in upstream. Working to resolve issue #1234 pertaining to &amp;ldquo;Performance for gizmo&amp;rdquo;, I work on a branch 1234-gizmo-performance. I mail a peer, John, with this information, as well as my repository location.</description></item><item><title>Things I learned today</title><link>https://lutzky.net/2008/04/28/things-i-learned-today/</link><pubDate>Mon, 28 Apr 2008 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://lutzky.net/2008/04/28/things-i-learned-today/</guid><description>You can use git on a VFAT disk (for example, a USB key) without all of the annoying mode issues, by using the following setting in .git/config:
[core] filemode = false What I haven&amp;rsquo;t figured out is how to do force a chmod in this situation; for example, if I create a new script, I was hoping to be able to git chmod +x it.
Cream is a very good editor if you&amp;rsquo;re used to Windows applications.</description></item><item><title>Really liking this git thing</title><link>https://lutzky.net/2007/09/18/really-liking-this-git-thing/</link><pubDate>Tue, 18 Sep 2007 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://lutzky.net/2007/09/18/really-liking-this-git-thing/</guid><description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been a very big proponent of Subversion so far, especially as a tool for collaborating on coding homework. However, I&amp;rsquo;ve recently been trying out Linus&amp;rsquo;s git. It&amp;rsquo;s very nice so far, and really seems to be catching on. Some good points:
Fast as all hell (much faster than Bazaar, although I haven&amp;rsquo;t given that the proper attention) No need for a central server; hell, no need for an internet connection at all, everything can be done over USB keys or whatnot No real need to configure any special server; just install git on it Very nice alternative to configuring write-control for all of the users Very easy branching and merging, finally!</description></item></channel></rss>
