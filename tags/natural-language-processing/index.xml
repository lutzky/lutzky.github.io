in natural language processing. I&amp;rsquo;ve learned quite a bit from it, and had a
chance to use a few of my favorite technologies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The project was coded in Python, which is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; my favorite programming
language - Ruby is. However, since Python is more popular at my workplace, and
seems to have a richer ecosystem around it (sometimes, at any rate), I&amp;rsquo;ve grown
to love it almost as much over the years. It&amp;rsquo;s quick, easy, and has fantastic
libraries; specifically, for this project, we made heavy use of the &lt;a href="http://nltk.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer "&gt;Natural
Language Toolkit&lt;/a&gt;. We used Git for source control and Github
for hosting, Travis for continuous integration, and ReadTheDocs for
documentation. All of these culminate in the project being handed in as a
single link: &lt;a href="http://github.com/lutzky/translationese" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer "&gt;http://github.com/lutzky/translationese&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
