I&amp;rsquo;ve learned quite a bit from it, and had a chance to use a few of my favorite technologies.
The project was coded in Python, which is not my favorite programming language - Ruby is. However, since Python is more popular at my workplace, and seems to have a richer ecosystem around it (sometimes, at any rate), I&amp;rsquo;ve grown to love it almost as much over the years.</description></item></channel></rss>
