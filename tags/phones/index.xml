I love being able to communicate textually with friends, coworkers and family. It&amp;rsquo;s ideal for a noisy pub; a somewhat-private conversation on a crowded bus; telling something to someone who may be asleep, so they see it first thing when they wake up; making quick responses while in a meeting without being rude (well, at least at my workplace it&amp;rsquo;s considered perfectly acceptable). It&amp;rsquo;s also very handy when you want to tell someone something they ought to write down, such as a phone number or something they should remember to buy.</description></item><item><title>Android</title><link>https://lutzky.net/2010/09/04/android/</link><pubDate>Sat, 04 Sep 2010 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://lutzky.net/2010/09/04/android/</guid><description>I&amp;rsquo;ve finally gotten the chance to get one of those newfangled Android phones.
I&amp;rsquo;ve recently &amp;ldquo;bought&amp;rdquo; a Samsung Galaxy Android phone (the older i7500, not the newer i9000 &amp;ldquo;S&amp;rdquo;) model. It&amp;rsquo;s a seriously serious upgrade from my old Nokia 6120 Classic, and as I broke the 6120&amp;rsquo;s screen and reverted back to my trusty old Nokia 6070 (which I couldn&amp;rsquo;t even get to run the GMail app), I was quite a happy camper switching to a modern phone.</description></item><item><title>Broken phone screen - data rescue</title><link>https://lutzky.net/2009/10/31/broken-phone-screen-data-rescue/</link><pubDate>Sat, 31 Oct 2009 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://lutzky.net/2009/10/31/broken-phone-screen-data-rescue/</guid><description>Last weekend I broke my Nokia 6120&amp;rsquo;s screen. I have a military phone, which is far cheaper, so I&amp;rsquo;ve decided to keep it offline. However, being the sentimental guy that I am, I did want to save all of my contacts and SMS messages (in addition to the photos, which presented less of a problem). This proved to be a bit of a challenge without the screen working.
Usually, when you connect the phone via USB, it asks if you want &amp;ldquo;PC Suite mode&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;Data Transfer mode&amp;rdquo;.</description></item><item><title>Whatever happened to black &amp;amp; white LCDs?</title><link>https://lutzky.net/2008/11/22/whatever-happened-to-black-white-lcds/</link><pubDate>Sat, 22 Nov 2008 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://lutzky.net/2008/11/22/whatever-happened-to-black-white-lcds/</guid><description>I had a Game Boy once. I could play it just about anywhere, and battery life - for the time - was great. I lost it at one point, and replaced it with a Game Gear, which sucked the life out of 6 AA batteries rather quickly. The Game Boy Color was actually decent on battery life, but since it didn&amp;rsquo;t have a backlight, you had to play it at very specific angles.</description></item></channel></rss>
