I love being able to communicate textually with friends,
coworkers and family. It&amp;rsquo;s ideal for a noisy pub; a somewhat-private
conversation on a crowded bus; telling something to someone who may be asleep,
so they see it first thing when they wake up; making quick responses while in a
meeting without being rude (well, at least at my workplace it&amp;rsquo;s considered
perfectly acceptable). It&amp;rsquo;s also very handy when you want to tell someone
something they ought to write down, such as a phone number or something they
should remember to buy. My problem isn&amp;rsquo;t with the concept of mobile textual
messaging - it&amp;rsquo;s with SMS, the &amp;ldquo;Short Message Service&amp;rdquo;, as provided by Israeli
carriers (and possibly worldwide).&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Android</title><link>https://lutzky.net/posts/android/</link><pubDate>Sat, 04 Sep 2010 09:26:00 +0000</pubDate><author>lutzky@gmail.com (Ohad Lutzky)</author><guid>https://lutzky.net/posts/android/</guid><description>&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ve finally gotten the chance to get one of those newfangled Android phones.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ve recently &amp;ldquo;bought&amp;rdquo; a &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samsung_Galaxy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">Samsung Galaxy
Android&lt;/a> phone (the older i7500,
not the newer i9000 &amp;ldquo;S&amp;rdquo;) model. It&amp;rsquo;s a seriously serious upgrade from my old
&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nokia_6120_classic" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">Nokia 6120 Classic&lt;/a>, and as I
broke the 6120&amp;rsquo;s screen and reverted back to my trusty old &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nokia_6070" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">Nokia
6070&lt;/a> (which I couldn&amp;rsquo;t even get to
run the GMail app), I was quite a happy camper switching to a modern phone.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Broken phone screen - data rescue</title><link>https://lutzky.net/posts/broken-phone-screen-data-rescue/</link><pubDate>Sat, 31 Oct 2009 02:32:00 +0000</pubDate><author>lutzky@gmail.com (Ohad Lutzky)</author><guid>https://lutzky.net/posts/broken-phone-screen-data-rescue/</guid><description>&lt;p>Last weekend I broke my Nokia 6120&amp;rsquo;s screen. I have a military phone, which is
far cheaper, so I&amp;rsquo;ve decided to keep it offline. However, being the sentimental
guy that I am, I did want to save all of my contacts and SMS messages (in
addition to the photos, which presented less of a problem). This proved to be a
bit of a challenge without the screen working.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Usually, when you connect the phone via USB, it asks if you want &amp;ldquo;PC Suite
mode&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;Data Transfer mode&amp;rdquo;. The &amp;ldquo;Data Transfer&amp;rdquo; mode has the phone show up
as a standard USB storage device, which allows for easy transfer of MP3 files,
photos and videos to and from the phone, without any nokia-specific software.
However, it only works for the external SD card, so you can&amp;rsquo;t use that to
access SMS messages or contacts.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Whatever happened to black &amp;amp; white LCDs?</title><link>https://lutzky.net/posts/whatever-happened-to-black-white-lcds/</link><pubDate>Sat, 22 Nov 2008 11:58:00 +0000</pubDate><author>lutzky@gmail.com (Ohad Lutzky)</author><guid>https://lutzky.net/posts/whatever-happened-to-black-white-lcds/</guid><description>&lt;p>I had a &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_boy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">Game Boy&lt;/a> once. I could play it
just about anywhere, and battery life - for the time - was great. I lost it at
one point, and replaced it with a &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_gear" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">Game
Gear&lt;/a>, which sucked the life out of 6
AA batteries rather quickly. The &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_Boy_Color" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">Game Boy
Color&lt;/a> was actually decent on
battery life, but since it didn&amp;rsquo;t have a backlight, you had to play it at very
specific angles.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
