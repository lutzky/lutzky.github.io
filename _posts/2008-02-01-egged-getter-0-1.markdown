Here's a little something I've been messing with: A simple fetcher script for
the [Egged](http://www.egged.co.il) (Israeli bus company) site. I've made a
deskbar applet which uses it, which was fun to do :) (I'm looking for other
cool ideas to implement as deskbar applets)

You can get it at
[http://lutzky.net/files/egged_getter](http://lutzky.net/files/egged_getter).
The readme file includes installation instructions (...which involve placing
the two included scripts in
`~/.gnome2/deskbar-plugin/modules-2.20-compatible/`.

There's also a [git](http://git.or.cz) repository here:
[http://git.lutzky.net/?p=ohad/egged_getter.git](http://git.lutzky.net/?p=ohad/egged_getter.git).
I don't think I've mentioned git on the blog before... It's freaking awesome.
It made me really despise subversion :). Besides the abundance of information
on [the main site](http://git.or.cz), there's [an excellent (and very amusing)
talk by Linus about it](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XpnKHJAok8). Also, I'm
giving a talk about it in Haifux - this coming Monday (February 4th), the Taub
building of the Technion, room 6, at 18:30.
