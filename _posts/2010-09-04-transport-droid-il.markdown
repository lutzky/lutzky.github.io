After a couple of days' messing with it, I'm releasing it: _Transport Droid
IL_! It's a handy little app for querying [Egged's site](http://egged.co.il/),
as well as the new [Ministry of Transportation site](http://bus.gov.il/), on
transportation information. This is pretty beta, but seems to work well enough.
