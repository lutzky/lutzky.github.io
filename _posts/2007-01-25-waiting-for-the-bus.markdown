I'm going home for the weekend, as usual. Unfortunately, the first bus of my
route comes by at highly unpredictable times - I've had it be an hour late on
me once. There are plenty of Wi-fi networks around the station - either WPA,
WEP or MAC-whitelisted... fortunately, someone was using the latter long enough
for me to catch him with Kismet. Thank you, stranger! :)

It's a sad state of affairs that people go ahead and limit access to their
wireless network. I keep mine wide open - מי שאוכל לבד, מת לבד.
