Myself, I'm a Ruby hacker. I send everyone within earshot to
[TryRuby](http://tryruby.hobix.com), code my sites using Rails, am surprised
that I'm using a php-based blog... you get the picture. Ruby is sometimes
called the Japanese Python, and comparisons are inevitable. I know very little
about Python, but I do know that...

* It has a larger community
* More GUI applications are written in it
* More bindings are available for it
* Its interpreter is much faster
* Not a far inferior language

Ruby certainly does have its advantages over it - trivial class expansion,
extremely concise syntax, seemingly better-suited for heavy usage of closures,
and Matz. Ya gotta love Matz.

I will be giving Python a try soon... I love learning new programming
languages. That's why I'm taking Programming Languages this coming semester.
