Recording this morning was excellent! Awesome studio, not expensive at all, and
a whole lot of fun. We've posted one song at [our myspace
page](http://myspace.com/switchblade777), and it seems that Lior has found an
apt name for the CD (hint) ;)

For those of you who don't want to visit Myspace (can't blame you), here's the
song we posted, as well as an extra track (my personal favorite), Falsely
Accused.

I really want to point out the **incredible** recording studio we used - it's a
place called MIXסולידי in Tel Hanania. The man charged us very little, and the
equipment and space are excellent. As you can probably tell, those are just
demo recordings - recorded "live", with plenty of mistakes, and with very
minimal balance and sound tweaking. We'll definitely be going back there to
record a more serious version.
