First of all, [new iPods won't work on
Linux](http://www.boingboing.net/2007/09/14/new-ipods-reengineer.html). Now,
while it's very obvious that the idea is to block competition against other
music vendors, that makes it even less legitimate. Good thing we're starting to
see some very nice cheap players out there - I've been rather impressed with
the [Meizu M6 MiniPlayer](http://en.meizu.com/product_m6.asp).  
  
Secondly, they didn't think of this: [Indexed search within the "Open"
dialog](http://www.gnome.org/start/2.20/notes/en/index.html#rnusers-file-management).
It's in Ubuntu Gutsy, and really makes desktop search (implemented with Tracker
in gutsy) worthwhile. Especially when attaching files in GMail :)
