So, I see I forgot to post my schedule for this semester...

As you can see, it's TTime! With a shiny new Cairo interface. We're back to the
Ruby version, too - as we have another coder on board, which is using his
compilation skills in order to write a new REPY parser.

You can also see it's only found one schedule. This is thanks to the [group
selection constraint][groupsel] which was finally coded. Yes, that's a link to
the [Github repository for TTime](http://github.com/lutzky/ttime). You're
welcome to help write some constraints :)
