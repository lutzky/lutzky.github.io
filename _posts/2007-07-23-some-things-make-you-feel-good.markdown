Some things renew your faith in people, in the time you spend with them.
Amazingly small things, considering their grand scope. Making things worse is
known to be easy, and rebuilding is one of the hardest things we have to do in
life. But sometimes, when things turn out to be completely different than they
seem - new perspective is gained, old perspective is found again, and like
something out of an old Disney cartoon, kitschy clouds of gloom make way for
kitschy rays of sunshine. Complete with the smiling sun and everything. Like
freakin' Roger Rabbit :)

Finally, the story gets the ending it deserves.
