I brought my Fender Squier Jazz Bass up to my Technion apartment. I hope it
won't have too much of an adverse effect on my studying... playing it (loud) is
great for stress, and I'm taking a jazz improvisation course next semester.

By the way - if any of you record with one of these, I highly recommend
[Arour](http://ardour.org), using a low-pass LADSPA filter. Also, activating
both pickups on about 80% does wonders against hum if you connect directly.
