I'm typing the lectures of the course 236343 Computability Theory this
semester. Attached are my lectures notes in PDF form:

[Computability Lecture Notes](http://yasmin.technion.ac.il/ohad/winter_2007/computability/computability_lecture.pdf)
[Computability Tutorial Notes](http://yasmin.technion.ac.il/ohad/winter_2007/computability/computability_tutorial.pdf)

If you also type the notes and would like to collaborate with me, I use a git
repository stored here:

<http://yasmin.technion.ac.il/ohad/git/computability.git>

To use it, install `git-core` and curl, and run

    git clone http://yasmin.technion.ac.il/ohad/git/computability.git

Any changes you have - send to me as patches, or push to your own repository
and send me a link. (Drawings would be most welcome, and you're obviously
welcome to add your name to the list of typers)

If you need git storage, try [repo.or.cz](http://repo.or.cz), or ask the T2
admins to install git :)
