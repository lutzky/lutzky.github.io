Reading some backlog on this blog, I found the following gem:

Yeah... not so anymore. For about four weeks (just a bit before the semester
started), my net connection was working excrutiatingly slow. Now, we're four
roommates here, so we started blaming each other. But then I had a guess - I
encrypted my connection with WPA/TKIP, and presto; the connection is now once
again too fast for my browser to handle (...which sent me back to Epiphany).
Guys, if you mooch wi-fi, please... be nice about it :(
