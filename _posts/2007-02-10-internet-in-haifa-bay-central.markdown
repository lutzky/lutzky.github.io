In the Haifa Bay Central bus station (מרכזית המפרץ), it's possible to get an
internet connection. HTTPS works automatically, and setting the proxy to
`proxy.technion.ac.il:8080` works for HTTP. I was unsuccessful in using
corkscrew to get SSH connections to tunnel over it as well, but perhaps there
is still a way.
