The more I use Python, the nicer it becomes. I'm currently working on a project
for a course, which involves somewhat heavy-duty database and algorithm work.
Python is my language of choice for it - let's hope it works out well.

In the meantime, I've found a really nice python shell called iPython
(available in apt) - it adds a bunch of stuff to the python shell which I
sorely missed from irb - autocompletion, auto-indentation, and - it seems -
adds a whole lot more.

Looks like I'll have to check django out as well. I've been working with Ruby
on Rails for quite a while now (and that's how I got introduced to Ruby in the
first place). Odd as it may be... do I have a new favorite language?
